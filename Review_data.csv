Lan Sabi in Phuket provided me with a retreat experience that surpassed all expectations and left an enduring mark on my soul.

Stepping into my room  I was greeted by a spacious space  thoughtfully equipped with every amenity I could desire during my retreat. The views from my room  whether of the mountains or the pool  provided a captivating and relaxing stay.One of the most exceptional aspects of my retreat was the warm and genuine hospitality extended by Lisa  the great host and owner of Lan Sabi. Her dedication to ensuring that every detail of my visit was flawlessly executed was evident in every interaction and experience. Whether it was her meticulous attention to personalized meals or her thoughtful accommodation of individual needs  Lisa's commitment to creating an unforgettable retreat experience was unparalleled.Speaking of meals  I must take a moment to celebrate the culinary journey at Lan Sabi. The chef's expertise shone through in every dish  and Lisa's dedication to accommodating dietary requirements only served to elevate the already exceptional dining experience.The personalized schedule offered at Lan Sabi was another hallmark of my retreat experience. It was tailored to my preferences  ensuring a perfect balance of rest  relaxation  and physical activities.My desire to return for an extended stay is a testament to the profound impact that Lan Sabi had on me.In conclusion  every aspect of my retreat at Lan Sabi in Phuket exceeded my expectations  leaving me with cherished memories and a profound sense of renewal.

Top notch  modern and new. Quiet area  great pool and excellent service.,5
Beautiful resort! You feel like at home and you can relax and enjoy in a dreamlike setting and do good for your body  mind and soul. You notice the love in every detail and are welcomed by heart people. The food  the room and the week-long program were great. I will definitely come back.,5
Such a great wellness retreat I've never been! All the people there are friendly  caring as well as the super nice environment with a cozy guest room! So amazed with those workshops designed by the founder and fellow collaborators  like yoga  singing bowl  beach meditation  vision board  astrology  qi gong etc. This stay rejuvenates my body  mind & soul  will definitely come back again. Highly recommended! ;),5
"English:""Lan Sabai is a bohemian hidden gem  just off the popular Rawai beach in Phuket. My husband and I spent 2 restful nights in this boutique resort getaway. We were well taken care of by Lisa and her team  led by Parn and Spotty the fiesty soi dog. We were fed with fresh local ingredients  bathed in natural  sustainable toiletries and greeted with happy birds chirping every morning. We were also impressed by the curation of high quality  designer led home furnishings and living ware. We will definitely be back to enjoy an idyllic time to focus on self-care and wellness again. Thank you <3""",5

A really great staycation spot for some chill-out time! We came for the weekend and absolutely loved the peaceful vibe and beautiful rooms decorated with tasteful  natural furnishings. We started our Saturday morning off with our own meditation by the pool to the sounds of the trickling water and birds  before joining Lan Sabai's Saturday Tai Chi  which exceeded all expectations. We left Lan Sabai feeling rested and relaxed  knowing that we'd soon be back for an overnight stay or to join one of the many great soul-focused activities that they host 😊,5
Nice place recommended to come there,5
Great place to work and relax. Spacious rooms  luxurious and well equipped. Large pool very suitable for a good swim. Friendly staff. Great possibilities for meetings  assessments and exercises. Located in the laid-back area in the south of Phuket  Thailand,5
I had a wonderful week at this amazing resort. It's a place to unwind and have a good time. The staff were very friendly and helpful  ensuring our stay was comfortable and enjoyable! The rooms are spacious  beautifully designed  and decorated with amazing pieces from Yoshiko Homeware  and most importantly  the beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are also beautiful and well-equipped. We started each day with a delicious breakfast featuring organic fruits from the garden! The pool is large  and my room had direct access to it  which was fantastic. The rooms on the first floor offer a stunning view! The host was warm and welcoming  organizing various activities for us  such as a boat trip and a guided tour of the elephant sanctuary. I also participated in a workshop here  which was very engaging! This place is a hidden gem where you feel secure and at ease. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to unwind and have a wonderful time. I wish I could have stayed here for many more weeks  I truly enjoyed it to the fullest!,5
Enjoyed last week. Felt incredibly good  just like at home  but in a beautiful resort with a beautiful room  ditto bathroom and a lovely swimming pool. Very hospitable and customer-oriented reception. Top! Definitely go back!,5
Beautiful resort with a nice swimming pool. Rooms were super clean and very nice. Very helpful and nice staff who speak English.,5
A top resort in the south of Phuket. An oasis of peace with every luxury.,5
Lisa's welcome was exceptional and the resort is a real little paradise. The place is ideal for organizing a group stay. The rooms are spacious  impeccably clean and decorated with great taste! I can't wait to organize another stay at Lansabai!,5
Lisa is a wonderful person & hostess. We really enjoyed our time in this incredible little paradise. Rooms were spacious & lovely furnished with @Yoshiko Home. A retreat resort with top notch facilities I highly recommend.,5
A beautiful luxury resort where you can fully recharge. The rooms are beautifully decorated in Yoskiho style with a luxurious bathroom. There is a lot to experience and discover on the island of Phuket. If you want to recharge  there is a large swimming pool and a spa in the resort. I often think back to LanSabai  the peace and quiet and the wonderful temperature. Lisa is a great hostess.,5
Amazing location! High quality service  clean rooms  loved the swimming pool and the delicious food. Highly recommended.,5
Sublime location where we and our management team were able to spend a wonderful week. The combination of good working conditions (fast Wi-Fi and a beautiful workspace)  good food and Lisa as a host who arranges everything down to the last detail is unique. Highly recommended to teams that have something to celebrate  want to end the year or want to retreat for a while.,5
Beautiful location and excellent services. Lisa is an excellent hostess.Beautiful swimming pool and many excursion options.,5
A little haven. Lisa is an excellent host who takes care of everything. Fluent in English and Dutch. Seamless and hugely enjoyable experience. Highly recommended.,5
Some time ago an invitation arrived on my online doorstep in which I was invited by the owner of Lan Sabai to book a week of me-time in her new retreat resort on Phuket. Without having to think long  I booked the trip.What a treat to be able to feel that warmth  especially in our autumnal November. Plus to meet other inspiring stories and people in a wonderful setting. Lan Sabai is such a beautiful resort with 8 identical rooms where you will become zen within 5 minutes. No stimuli from TV or other tourists  you can completely relax by the pool or in the spacious room of 44m2 that is fully equipped.Your room has a kettle and coffee maker and is beautifully furnished with home accessories from @yoshiko. In short  a high-end resort where we are spoiled to the core with healthy food  yoga classes  master classes and some fantastic trips around the island.I would say book your week of me-time. If you are a coach or want to do something special with friends  then this resort is definitely recommended.,5
A little paradise in the south of Phuket :-),5
Such a beautiful place  perfect for enjoying a relaxing time in a natural environment away from the chaos of Patong. The staff are attentive and polite. Don't miss out on the yoga activities; it was an interesting experience for me. A place worth visiting and revisiting.,5
"I'm the CEO of a New York-based integrative medicine company and consulting services  with thousands of clients from around the world seeking advice on the best places to book long stays for their healing journey.I traveled the world to search for those places  here is my experience when I walked into Sentosa.The spa is absolutely unprofessional  unorganized  and truly disappointing. I cringe as I recall the experience of walking into their empty spa management office.The management is sadly dysfunctional and ineffective. I'm not sure how they have the nerve to charge top dollars and provide service that is so low grade.Their manager was saying that ""their advertising wasn't working "" and yet they turn away top-paying customers when they walk in.What a backwards way of thinking.I walked in (because no one replied to my WhatsApp messages to request a booking). I was ready to book 9 800+ Thai baht treatments over the course of 3 days  but was turned away by the manager  saying their masseuse doesn't want to work. She had to literally beg the masseuse to work for them. Ridiculous.The masseuse appears to be an independent contractor that they bring from outside  and she gave me the feeling that she was doing me a big favor :) She definitely didn't look like she was interested in providing any services. The manager really did nothing to assist or to secure that treatment booking.To sum it up  instead of walking into the greatest  most healing pampering experience as you would expect a spa that charges 1 000TB for each service  I found myself in a very uncomfortable  somewhat humiliating situation.Not a very good way to increase the bottom line of this establishment's owner financial health.I gave them more than one chance and left my phone number and suggested they contact me if their masseuse decides that she wants to work. The manager assured me that they will  but it's been 3 days and I have yet to hear back from them. Sigh.Do yourself a favor  find yourself another place  don't waste your time and effort.This experience was truly disappointing because the place has such great potential that goes to waste.Sadly  I do not recommend.In contrast  the restaurant upstairs deserves many compliments from staff to food choices to the chef who is extraordinary. The restaurant team is professional  well-organized  always ready to serve healthy  delicious  nutritious meals.",1
I felt like the whole set up was a complete rip off. I didn't even get a room at the resort but was placed in a room 500 meters from the resort. They couldn't care less about me and their dedication was way below par. I left after two days feeling completely disillusioned. Loads of money for an absolutely poor program. Please don't go here.,1
Santosa Wellness resort has been an outstanding experience for me and my mom. This is my 3rd full / juice fasting retreat in Thailand and I am so happy to have chosen this new location for me. One of the best parts of the retreat is the thoughtful  caring  professional and almost family like approach of all staff. They are organized  everything is under control  yet they remain flexible. At the end of our 8 day fast  I had too much mucus plaque to call is quits  so decided to continue – Sheryl has allowed me to continue doing 1 more colonics and given me the last implant home with take away final food.||One day we went out and skipped some program parts  the staff has allowed us to postpone the massage with no charge and did a special 2 hour session for my mom the next day.|The staff at the restaurant are absolutely fantastic. While we didn’t manage to enjoy much for the food  we had our last dinner before fast and it was beyond delicious  fresh  beautiful. We had multiple teas / day though during our fast and all choices were delicious. The fruit juices that my mom was given was fresh and very tasty  made with love. 2 coconut juices helped to keep our electrolytes in check.|Colonics were well organized and the facilities for it were great – you could take a shower after and everything was super clean and well run. |Ice bath was one of the highlights  along with steam back helped to revive at night. |One of the highlights was the training / fitness program – the resort had a variety of professional high quality trainers that taught very fun classes like Zumba  aerial yoga  Nidra yoga  fit ball  breathing.

The restaurant is phenomenal  many tasty raw vegan dishes and a vast variety of cold pressed juices and smoothies. The purity salad is out of this world. Calm place with a nice view. Highly recommended.,5
Very nice food every home made and they have big options vegetarian and vegan. And you can request also in vegan ,5
We did a one day relax package at 1500 baht it was exceptional value for money. All staff were lovely and very committed to health. The vegan food and juices were world class! Our package included breathwork  meal and juice  a massage and a hot sauna and ice plunge. A very full day. I did a healing treatment with Karn and she was exceptional and very gifted. After having had two recent operations she identified my health issues within the first few minutes of the session and after the treatment the area that had been numb in my abdomen for over 6 months post surgery was completely gone - that’s after only one treatment and she gave me a number of things to follow up with on my return home. She is the real deal as far as “healers” go and this retreat was excellent values for money. A must try for anyone seeking health improvement!,5
I stayed at Santosa for a 3-day full detox fast  I went for 3 days as I’ve never done anything like this before.The whole experience from start to finish was just wonderful  it was surprisingly easy not to eat for 3 days. You have cleanse drinks  supplements  fresh coconut  ginger shot and an optional evening broth. A true retreat in a peaceful location.All of the team are super supportive and your days are pretty busy with lots of options of classes so there isn’t much time to think about food. Classes are completely optional though so you can have plenty of free time if you want it.Rooms are modern  spacious and very comfortable.The colema was a new experience for me and everyone was really professional.Anyone contemplating going - I recommend just to book!Shout out to the team …Sherryl helped organise the trip for me and was nothing but helpful and pleasant the entire time. I’m a customer with 100 questions and nothing was too much hassle.Stas was my program guide and yoga teacher  super informative and friendly. It was my first ever yoga class and he made me feel comfortable. I had an intro meeting and then meeting at the end to go through my results. Very educational on how to continue a clean life after a detox and cleanse.Bhupin in the kitchen was great. I didn’t get to try much food apart from my break the fast meal  but the evening Broth was great and everything else I saw coming out of the kitchen with juices and raw meal plans looked great.Jeanly  May and Belle on reception were great. Always friendly and motivating you through the day.Last but not least my masseuse was amazing. I recommend the relax massage.Always a welcoming smile from everyone when you come into the resort!Would book again. Thanks Team.,5
Really beautiful view,5
The hospitality of all staff at Santosa is impeccable. Everyone was so friendly  nice and professional. The premises were clean and the rooms comfortable. The restaurant served delicious vegan food which we tried before our 3 day juice fast. The juices served for the juice fast were tasty and varied. On top of 5 juices  we got a coconut after every colema and hot broth in the evening. There was a massage and other activities every day. With so much to do and drink we had no time to feel hungry or bored. If you're thinking of trying a detox program  don't hesitate  go to Santosa.,5
Wellness center with yoga  pilates and others. Also a restaurant with vegan menu with fantastic views,4
The employees are not friendly at all. Please train the employees. I feel very upset.,1
We did not stay in the hotel but came for the highly recommended vegan restaurant. This is the best vegan restaurant we ever had  definitely worth the trip! Kids loved it too.,5
I stayed at Santosa for 4 nights and it was a great experience. The management  staff and trainers are super friendly  welcoming and professional. The vegan food is the best I ever had  the hotel rooms are spacious  super clean with a fantastic views of the bay.If you want to escape from the busy city life  Santosa is the perfect place to workout  relax  fast and feeling home away from home.,5
Nice selection of vegan buffet. Will come again!,4
Santosa kindly reached out and offered a massage and transfer from my accommodation. The service was brilliant!On the 10th of March  we messaged Santosa through WhatsApp to inform them that we would be arriving at 6 pm on the 11th of March for an ice bath and sauna on my birthday. We arrived at 5:55 pm on March 11th but were informed that there was no ice left for the ice bath. They had not purchased enough for the evening. We were told that we needed to prebook - which we had already done. I asked if they could purchase more ice for the evening since we had taken a taxi to the spa specifically for our reservation - they said no.,5
Outstanding!!! I came for a full fast. It was above all my expectations. Having done detox centers in the US  this by far was superior. From beginning to end I wouldn’t change a thing. The night before my fast started I had a Cesar salad/sauce was cashew based and mushroom resoto. Both to die for. The center is set in the jungle with breath taking views of the ocean and giant Buddha. The program itself was fantastic. Fresh raw juices  variety of classes  The best massages (Emi was so good I extended my time)  colema (colonics)  sauna/ice bath  sprinkled with beach visits and hikes to giant Buddha. The staff is extremely accommodating. They r also efficient  knowledgeable  caring. I can’t say enough about them. I wish I could take them all home. I’m planning my next visit already. Going to end with a few days of raw food and vegetarian cooking class which I didn’t have time for this time.,5
The views of this restaurant are a dream  the service is top-notch  and the food is delicious. I will be back,5
Not a bad condo  but not the largest apartments.,5
The food was brought very quickly  everything was delicious  we will definitely come again.,5
I call it Instagram food.Though it looks really good  the food was cold and not tasty for me  small dishes and expensive.I left still hungry.,3
Such a nice and cosy place I was doing a full fasting program and it was such an amazing experience. Mainly because of the people who work there - Sherryl  May  Stas and others  they became like a family for me. So grateful 🙏🏻 Big thank you to Em - the lady who does massage  she has a gift! The best massage ever! For those interesting in detox  yoga or raw vegan food  highly recommend,5
Long time wanted to come and finally got there. 5+ stars. Very very nice and cosy place. There is calm and relaxed atmosphere  beautiful view. Food is very delicious. Who loves vegan and healthy food should definitely come and try.,5
I underwent a three-day water cleanse. I'm thrilled Such lightness in my body! It feels like I've been reborn I thought it would be difficult to endure three days of fasting  but it turned out to be the opposite. They provide food cleansing and enriching supplements  I didn't feel hungry. And there's not much time for it. Yoga twice a day  massage  sauna  pool  etc.The staff are very friendly and smiling Everything is well organized Thank you for your care I recommend it,5
Great place,5
Outstanding food. I've been vegan for 7 years now so I've eaten a lot of vegan food HahaThe chef and kitchen staff here absolutely know what they are doing.Very diverse menu  clear descriptions of what each meal / juice / smoothie contains.All good is marked Raw or Cooked which is always helpful at a raw food restaurant.I ordered a main Raw Spaghetti Pomodoro  the serving size was so generous I couldn't believe it. Only 200THB too.Seriously delicious I wanted to lick my plate 😋Fresh ingredients  very flavoursome and the presentation was on point too.The photo attached to this review is a screen shot from a video so doesn't do it justice.I am 100% coming back here and I00% recommend this Santosa  even non-vegans would love this place!,5
All in it’s just vegan heaven People are super friendly and the food is amazing,5
On Saturdays  there is also a vegan buffet here until 10 pm.,4
One of the most beautiful sunset spots on the island excellent rooms and service!,5
It's an alfresco vegan restaurant with a good view. Beware of stairs though  not for the old and frail! Dishes were definitely very healthy and tasted very healthy too.if you know what I mean. Might offend certain sensibilities but definitely worth trying at least once. I didn't have the wines because I was driving but I assume they'd make everything taste better.,5
Beautiful,5
By far the best vegan food I have tasted. The chef is amazing! I am from Miami and I have lived in Dubai; I know my gourmet vegan foods. The food and intimate hospitality were amazing. The classes were also amazing and intimate. I am excited about returning in the future!,5
Experience Delicious Vegan Buffet in Phuket.,5
Excellent place for physical and emotional detox. The staff is super professional and friendly. The food and service are excellent. Highly recommended.,5
Delicious food and very nice atmosphere.,4
The facility overall is very appealing and clean. Treatment rooms for the Colema are clean. The juice bar with a large open space to relax is beautiful. The sports offerings are diverse and very appealing as well. I especially liked the Breathwork. What wasn't good was the meditation because the woman spoke with a soft monotonous voice the whole time! That's not acceptable! It wasn't a guided meditation but rather monotonous chatter. Another issue was that there was no internet in the room because the facility is apparently divided into two parts. And in the area where the rooms are located  there was intense renovation going on. I did change rooms  but the construction noise was still clearly audible at the pool. The food was very good  excellently prepared RAW food ideas and very tasty! Unfortunately  I lost weight at the beginning but gained something in return. Having a colema twice a day  after a few days  the body starts to reject it  saying it's too much. This was the case for others as well. Not quite balanced.,1
I really like the view in the restaurant. Also all the dishes served very beautifully and everything is super healthy. Staff is friendly and I also like lots of different flavours. Choose this restaurant to celebrate my upcoming birthday!,5
"The translation of the text is: ""Grass his uncle vegetarian restaurant  grandpa climb for you""",1
I stayed at Santosa for one week from the 24th Jan on a juice only programme. Having never done anything like this before I was a little nervous as to what to expect. The staff soon put me at ease with their professionalism and calming attitudes. To name them would be unfair because I'd probably forget someone as everyone from the cleaners right through to the instructors were absolutely marvellous. After a few days I started to see and feel a real difference in myself and by the end of the week was literally full of energy and vibrance. This after fasting from food for 6 days (beautiful juices aside). When I say the whole experience was probably one of the best of my holidaying life this would be no exaggration. I'm back a week and miss it every day. Will be booking up again soon and can't recommend it enough.,5
A beautiful resort  amazing food and of course you pay for the quality  their dishes are well balanced and so delicious  if you are vegan or a person that is interested in high quality plant-based food I really recommend visiting them,5
Great vegan choices! The risotto is a vegan symphony and makes me wonder over and over again how the chef magically manages it to taste this great!,4
Although the restaurant ran out of coffee  the server made up for it by giving us a complimentary small bottle of homemade matcha green tea kombucha to go with our avocado key lime pie . delicious!,4
Best vegan restaurant in Phuket,5
Being new to detox and fasting  they were very knowledgeable in these areas. I learned a lot and felt very comfortable asking questions. They were also very accommodating to my needs and flexible with my schedule. The fitness instructors (especially Pimmy) have great energy and offer a program suitable for everyone. Their variety of juices were delicious  and their main meals looked very healthy and nutritious. My room  as well as the rest of the center  was very clean and quiet with good facilities and amazing views of the sea in the distance. I never found myself wondering what to do next as the program was clear  and the small detox activities didn't overwhelm me  leaving me with time for myself. The evenings were quiet with opportunities to watch a film. The location was perfect  quiet with clean air. More activities are a short car ride away or accessible with the free transport.,5
Everything is very delicious! Whole grain bread with hummus  very well seasoned & Chia pudding with apple  coconut & cinnamon delightful,5
Just because it's a vegan place - I give it a 4. And for the service. The guy was very polite and changed the purple sour kombucha to a non-sour one). The food is very mediocre  I had a bowl and rolls. Well. not very good at all. The presentation is beautiful  though.,4
Lovely vegan food. Had the Zen Bowl and the chocolate mousse. Just delicious and the service was amazing too staff very helpful and friendly.,5
I thought this was an absolutely great restaurant. Firstly  the location at the top of the hill is fantastic. The view was spectacular. Also  all the staff were charming and friendly and the service was great. Then you could see the sheer joy on the face of the chef as she watched customer's faces lighting up as they saw the food  which was magnificently presented. Furthermore  the food was seriously delicious and innovative. I am an avid meat and fish eater but I left feeling 110% satisfied. Would recommend to anyone.,5
Many vegan and raw delicious dishes,5
This place was incredible. We traveled to Phuket with a vegan friend and finding this place was like heaven. The menu options were so varied and everything was absolutely delicious. We were there after sunset and the frog chorus was pretty intense  so that's the only thing I would keep in mind.,5
Had two sessions of yoga daily  one as a class and the other as a private session. Every yoga session was enriching with experienced yoga teachers  Stas  Denis and a lady who taught Yin. Love especially the Arial yoga! The other classes like mindful meditation and TRX were invigorating perfect mix in between yoga sessions.|Not forgetting the wonderful relaxing daily massage. That's something not to be missed.|Since departure from the retreat  had missed the tasty and Instagram-worthy food! Every dish is delectable. |The room was amazingly big and clean with a good view. |Thanks to all the friendly staff in Santosa who had made this retreat comfortable and memorable. I'll definitely return!,
Very nice  quality and tasty vegan food. I was amazed.,5
Raw and vegan meal  sauna  yoga and pool. But no air conditioning,4
Our 5-days yoga retreat was the best decision ever. Santosa is the perfect mix between healthy movement  healthy eating and a healthy mind  and on top of that  they have the friendliest and most helpful staff! Stas and Dennis are excellent yoga teachers  and with Stas  we even got to try new yoga styles such as Aerial and Acro Yoga - so much fun! Additionally  they offered incredibly insightful morning talks on nutrition  detoxification  and meditation  from which we learned a lot! Shrene's smile and cheerful demeanor brightened our day. The vegan food - whether for breakfast  lunch  or dinner - was some of the best we've ever had! We already miss the place and will definitely come back!,
Food was absolutely fantastic  the smoothies were the best I've ever had. The all you can eat buffet was plentiful and diverse. Will return,5
Great. Vegan restaurant. Very healthy,5
If you love food then you must eat here.||The menu is fantastic and everything on offer is a taste sensation.||So much so that we have now begun to order the food online with foodio. ||I have had a pizza delivered that was so tasty and for a gluten free  dairy free  meat free pizza  I would put up there with one of the best I have had. And guilt free.||Well done Santosa.,
Fantastic gourmet vegan food. Do a monthly vegan meet up with 4 course meal  very inventive raw vegan courses. Amazingly tasty and healthy,5
I wanted to try the Coconut Yogurt. Theirs is better than the one I make. I wonder how they do it?,5
The food is alright but nothing special. We were the only ones there and we struggled to get their attention and it’s a little more expensive than other places. Such a shame because it could be an amazing location.,3
Best place to rehabilitate! Amazing vegan restaurant too. Pai was a champion!,5
Amazing place. A bustling health center  people from all over the world come here  mostly from Asian countries  to practice yoga and detox. 200 baht with a taxi and you're at the sea (or 300 if you order from reception) they have a sauna  spa center  workshop center  restaurant  rooms  and juice bar. We only dined at the restaurant. The food is completely vegan  the service is amazing  the place is sparkling  the food is tasty and fresh  amazing vegan cheeses  and everything tastes good  with a stunning view of the sea and the huge statue of the Big Buddha on the mountain in front. We will definitely come back sometime  even if not for detox and yoga workshops  we will come to eat in the future.,5
A bit overpriced for the spa usage and the gym is small with missing free weights and not much variety. Very clean though and is close to our location  so practical as well.,3
Excellent healthy food. Large menu both cooked and raw food.,5
The accommodation was extremely expensive. We ended up not doing a detox. We couldn't leave there quickly enough.,2
The best vegan buffet on the island,5
"It's time to debunk another myth about proper nutrition. If we talk about this place as a restaurant  about the quality of service  the beauty of dish presentation  the waiting time. it's not at all at a restaurant level  but a Thai eatery with ""horse"" prices for shredded vegetables in various forms.Well  the service and presentation are okay  the place itself is very beautiful  sunsets  gazebos  trees all around. sets a romantic mood. But the food  the main reason people go to a restaurant - to eat deliciously  try new recipes  and unexpected culinary delights. Here  everything is not tasty  and we tried about 12 dishes  all the same  with sour lemon sauces poured over everything  even in the shakes and smoothies.Gentlemen restaurateurs  proper nutrition is not just beautifully cut vegetables. It's a concept  it's beautiful presentation  it's delicious dishes with a twist.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone  don't fall for the advertising and beautiful photos of dishes  in reality  it's a rip-off and a waste of money(((. Spaghetti carbonara - 220 baht  in fact  thinly sliced zucchini for 20 baht/piece with a sour sauce.",1
Great complex and procedures. I was at a one-day detox  everything was very enjoyable  various activities and pleasant staff. Cool restaurant with a sea view and a very interesting selection of vegan dishes. I recommend ),5
Great vegan food !!,5
I spent 3 wonderful days  very good teacher and a good support team  good advice and good follow-up  very good massages  very good raw vegan cuisine  juice bar. I highly recommend,5
The nice restaurant with good vegan and raw vegan food.,5
Great complex  beautiful view  vegan restaurant overlooking the sea!,5
The Santosa restaurant is located on the hill of a mountain  the dining room has spectacular views of Karon.The staff is attentive and friendly  and the menu is very extensive and with a quite surprising variety for a restaurant where all dishes are vegan.My experience was very enriching and my palate enjoyed the different flavors of the chosen dishes.The plate with different types of cheese was spectacular  it would be hard for me to decide which one was my favorite. It was accompanied by lentil sprouts  apples  and pomegranate seeds.As for the main dishes  the same  a large quantity and a very enriching fusion of flavors.Without a doubt  a restaurant where one will enjoy like a child.I will repeat.,5
Excellent team. Great healthy eats. Great massage. Can't wait to return for more.,5
Outstanding food in a beautiful setting  and excellent service. Vegan menu with plenty of options and a great assortment of juice mixes and smoothies. The vegan cheese are incredibly tasty.,5
I had the best meal and the best service thus far in Thailand. Keep up the good work,5
It is a place where they promote health  yoga classes  and the instructors are very good  professional  and with a very good vibe  the vegan juices and food are delicious  some of the best I have tried  the sauna is amazing and the detox treatment highly recommended  one of the distinctive features of the place and all with wonderful views. I highly recommend it.,5
Amazing vegan foods and drinksNice atmosphereNice viewNice place,5
Great vegan food beautifully presented with an angelic view  well worth the trip down to the south of the island.BTW Very beautifully designed menu!,5
Great place. Everything is very tasty. | We visited the restaurant in March. All dishes are delicious  the food is organic. The main thing is tasty and healthy. We recommend this place to everyone who follows a healthy lifestyle. Oh  and here you can contemplate the delightful sunset!,5
The Santosa Centre is attached to Ocean View residences where I was staying and they share facilities. I went to two yoga classes there  one good and one the worse class I have ever been to. Anyone going there is likely to have a mixed experience until the managers enforce some ‘yoga etiquette’ on those taking the class.The classes take place on an open deck with some seating around. In my second class there were only four of us. However  the class was interrupted several times by an onlooker sitting far too close to us. He walked over to talk loudly to his friend once the class had started  drowning out the teacher. When asked to be quiet  he then proceeded to take pictures of his friend  including the participants of the class. When asked to sit down  he called loudly for the waitress to bring him a drink. It was an extremely unsettling start and his voyeuristic behavior was uncomfortable.Once he finally fell silent  the drains truck arrived  again drowning out the teacher. Then the teacher interrupted the class herself when a caterpillar appeared on the scene - demanding the maids bring a broom etc. Not a peaceful experience at all.I met some others from my first class who had had experiences similar to what happened in the second class. I asked to speak to the teacher who said she had to remain neutral. No apology was given and no offer of recompense. When I told her I felt obliged to bring this experience to others  she told me to ‘do what’s in my heart’. Well  that means telling the truth. So here it is.,1
Absolutely divine meal  view was very nice. Staff were friendly although a little occupied on phones and chatting. Best vegan cheese board I have ever had. If your up for spending a little more money the food is absolutely delicious. Very limited bar menu though  glasses of house wine or bottles of import wine  or non alcoholic beverages (fair enough as it’s a detox centre),4
Being a vegan restaurant  the best thing to do is to come for delicious food  large portions  reasonable prices  good service staff  and dedicated chefs for every dish.,5
"10 out of 10. Worthy establishment! | They cooked wearing gloves and the kitchen was open. Clean. This is a big rarity for Thailand. One of the best places I've had the pleasure to visit. The head chef came to us and guided us through the kitchen! Water was brought to us immediately. | I definitely recommend the lasagna and ice cream! | I will come back for more! Will continue tasting)| Incredible view and pleasant music. Perfect for dinner  as it offers a view of the sunset! It seems like every Wednesday and Saturday evenings they have a ""Swedish buffet"" vegan & raw. Cheesecakes are very good! Check out the photos.",5
Visited for dinner. Best vegan food around:) Cheerful staff and restaurant surrounded by jungle. Stunning (bring mossie spray:),4
Paradise is vegan,5
Very good vegan cuisine here! I searched everywhere in Phuket for some upper scale vegan dining  but couldn’t find a good place. A local recommended this place and I’m glad we came. Very good service as well  bravo! The prices is a little high  but it’s nice to get away from stalls and malls and sit down for a real meal. When comparing to USA restaurants  I think the price is well worth it. The view is also very nice at sunset. Check this place out!,5
The best vegan restaurant ever!!! Perfect service  amazing view  clean and very nice  highly recommended Excellent vegan restaurant  healthy and tasty food  excellent service  amazing view  recommended with love.,5
The database caused a 1 000 000 dollar level of damage with love.,5
The rules here are unforgettable at 3:00. I rate the atmosphere and spa procedures. Not very excited about the restaurant. Although the menu is quite interesting and diverse. Perhaps I chose not a very successful dish. The atmosphere is magnificent. The views are beautiful. The spa is beyond praise. I did the Shirdara procedures for myself. It's divine! I recommend it to everyone.,5
We have been vacationing in Phuket for 13 years and place a great value on good vegan food with a high raw food content. Last week we went to Santosa for the buffet dinner. We were very disappointed. Very basic food. Rice  salads  and all mushy overcooked vegetables. Mosquitoes everywhere during dinner  as there is only the terrace. Today we wanted to give it a second chance with à la carte. Maybe it was just a bad day. It was even worse. The passion fruit soup tasted like absolutely nothing. Upon our complaint  they brought us a lime and salt. I have never experienced this in a gourmet restaurant. We had to send it back and still pay for it. The Karma Ravioli was totally oversalted and the avocado cream was very watery. Our pasta lasagna was layered with a soggy bun instead of pasta dough and 2/3 consisted of minced meat substitute tofu. No herbs and no seasoning. Actually very embarrassing. The chef just laughed mockingly. It was important for us to be heard. No interest here. By the way  the menu has been the same for 3 years. It used to be seasoned though. Very sad for Santosa. The hotel's location is surrounded by concrete buildings right next to a main road. Lots of smog  mosquitoes  and poor air quality. The view of the sea is beautiful. But these experiences do not save it anymore. Not a good recommendation in 2018.,1
We were riding a moped following the navigator  it kept trying to lead us off-road the whole time  so we had to break a few rules on the highway. There is a parking lot where you can leave the moped. We climbed the stairs and ended up at the reception. We arrived at the hotel solely for a massage. I chose the Shiradora massage  while my husband chose a back massage. While we were waiting  they brought us cold water  which was very welcome. The atmosphere around was relaxing  quiet. Each of us was taken to our massage room. It turned out that Shiradora is just a regular hot oil massage  I was expecting something more relaxing and transcendent. But overall  the massage was very high quality. After that  we were taken to a shower  an outdoor shower  just outside the door. Then we were taken to the reception area  served tea  and that's when I felt complete relaxation and solitude. My husband also really enjoyed the massage. At the end of the stay  he said it was the best one we've ever had. The prices are higher than in regular salons. I would gladly stay there for a few more days to enjoy the peace  solitude  and relaxation. While we were there  we only noticed one other guest and a couple who were leaving.,5
We stayed at a lodging near Santosa Wellness in Phuket for about ten days  so we inquired about visiting and classes. My friend and I  who are day workers  mentioned that we wouldn't be able to attend all 10 classes as our stay is short and we also plan to go on other marine tours. We asked if we could attend the classes together and split them. (1 class - 350THB / 10 classes - 3 000THB)The staff said it was possible  so we made the payment. We applied for a reservation for the Aerial Yoga class at 6pm on the same day  but when we revisited in the evening  it seemed that the handover of reservation confirmations between the afternoon and morning staff was not done properly  resulting in exceeding the capacity. Therefore  we had to split the class into two sessions at 6pm and 7pm. In the end  we wasted an hour without receiving any apologies or proper explanations and attended the 7pm class. Furthermore  contrary to what the day staff said  the night staff mentioned that two people cannot use the 10-class coupon together and that they had no authority or responsibility. As a result  we were only able to attend the Aerial Yoga class together this time  but for the subsequent classes  only one person could participate  so we could only attend for 4 hours. We visited the manager to raise our concerns  but couldn't meet them. Finally  during the third visit  the main manager was in a meeting  so we had the opportunity to talk to another manager and explain our situation.Your staff provided incorrect information  so please cancel the 10 classes payment on this card. We also requested to pay separately for the 4 classes we attended at 350THB * 4 classes = 1 400THB  but our request was denied.The manager only expressed apologies  stating that only the remaining number of classes on the coupon can be attended  and originally only one person could attend  but they specially allowed two people to use it together.Firstly  we made the payment because your staff said two people could use it. We are not demanding to make something that is not possible  possible.It was not our mistake  but your staff provided incorrect information.Secondly  the night staff only mentioned that two people cannot attend the class together  without making any effort to resolve the issue. They wasted our time by prioritizing others who approached them during our conversation. We want a refund as we have limited time left in Phuket  but our repeated requests were met with insincere apologies.Thirdly  we requested to speak with the staff we initially discussed the class and payment with  but this request was also denied.Fourthly  since we have never received a proper explanation  we demanded to see documents containing the explanation and your terms and conditions. However  we were shrugged off with a casual response that this is common and then they disappeared.Do you think the manager's job is only to sell and extend classes to new customers?Even though your staff provided incorrect information resulting in financial  time  and mental losses for the customers  the manager seemed completely unaware and when we requested a consultation  they only thought about their income and avoided responsibility.For anyone who may use this center in the future  I recommend making a reservation and keeping the confirmation receipt to save your time. Also  when booking other programs  I recommend leaving clear evidence on documents to protect your money  time  and rights.It is regrettable that the management system is not well-established and the manager's handling ability is lacking at the wellness center  but the advantage of this place is that the facility itself is clean and Ms. Kim's yoga classes are excellent. Additionally  except for the desk night staff  the employees are generally friendly.,1
Friendly staff  delicious food and tea  nice environment :),5
Affordable massages and delicious Italian food  what's not to love?,5
Beautiful view  very delicious raw food dishes!,5
Very delicious raw and vegan cuisine. Great place for breakfast.,5
I recommend this place to all raw foodists and vegans! Very delicious  and beautiful view!,5
Perfect vegan place although a bit on higher side. They also run detox programs,5
A very tasty restaurant with high vegetarian cuisine. Every Thursday at 4:00 pm there are cooking classes for vegetarian food. And on Saturdays  there is a vegetarian buffet.,5
The sauna and the vegetarian restaurant at Kata Beach,5
Very nice location and easy to find with big sign by the road. Food is fantastic. Large choices for different taste. Very friendly and efficient staff. If you are into good food  then definitely try this place. The minestrone soup brought me back to my childhood cause it taste exactely like my mum did it. I really recommend to try and I sure will be back. Thank you,5
Very professional  a quality place to recharge. The food is delicious; The team is lovely  everyone is at your service to please you and make your stay enjoyable. I highly recommend the masseuses who spare no effort to please the clientele. Extremely clean place and quality care.,
Wow. The menu is full of mouth watering vegan dishes to choose from; half of which I've never heard of. I had the quinoa salad  which is flavorful without any spices. The chef is extremely friendly and enjoys his work. We had a lovely chat about his work and cooking philosophy. That gives this beautifully setup place a lovely personality all together  which you must experience.I'm going back to this place for sure before leaving the country.This is my third visit and I would classify this place as the best vegetarian restaurant on the island. I've tried the rest  don't waste your money,5
The menu is so incredible it was hard to make a decision! Wish we had more time to visit again!,5
We have lived and visited many places in Thailand and tried many vegan restaurants both for work and for pleasure and personal ethical choice. The Santosa is definitely the best in the country because it is totally different from both Thai and more Western ones that always offer Lebanese or Mexican cuisine dishes. Here the dishes are all well taken care of  well balanced in flavors and portions  many are Italian dishes revisited in a sublime way. The presentation also plays a fundamental role. The staff is very knowledgeable and among the most professional seen in Thailand. The place is very beautiful and relaxing. The prices are absolutely fair. Definitely a place to visit. We ate lasagna  mushroom fettuccine  pesto linguine  pumpkin ravioli  yogi raw soup  gnocchi  eggplant cutlet  tiramisu and some really excellent mashed potatoes. Everything was incredible. We really recommend it to anyone who wants to eat and nourish themselves in an absolutely healthy and cruelty-free way without giving up the pleasures of the table.,
A great Health & Spa Center located on Kata Hill amidst tropical plants and with a great view down to the sea. The staff is very friendly and always strives to give the guest the feeling of an exclusive wellness vacation. I had a great large apartment overlooking the bay of Kata Beach. Everything was super clean at all times. || The idea of a retreat is perfectly executed. I had the Yoga & Spa Package and could start every morning with a yoga session. Followed by a morning meeting where great and interesting topics about nutrition  toxins  etc.  were discussed. || The vegan food perfectly complements the well-being. Everything tastes excellent and through the treatments  one not only feels detoxified and pampered (daily massage treatments!) but also healthy and rejuvenated. || With a stay at Santosa  one gives oneself and one's body the best gift. Health and new energy! |||| I can only highly recommend it!!!,
We came here for the raw food restaurant and did not regret it. The dishes are very interesting and tasty. I really liked the Raw burger. But the most delightful were the desserts - chocolate cake  cheesecake. And especially the chocolate candies with pistachios. Just insanely delicious! By the way  keep in mind that all the dishes are very large and one is enough to get full! Due to our inexperience  we ordered three dishes each  and in the end  we almost burst. The average price per dish is 200 baht. And don't forget to try the Raw cappuccino. Very delicious!,5
Incorrect address. It is located a little further.,1
We go to this place constantly. They make the most delicious cheesecakes for raw foodists here. Very tasty salads and a huge selection of desserts. As a tradition  we always take wheatgrass shots. It's simply an elixir of youth and beauty. I recommend trying the ice cream: delicious and healthy made with coconut milk. The views from this little restaurant are simply stunning! I suggest coming to watch the sunset right here  I'm sure it will leave no one indifferent.,
Exceeded the expected wonderful experience  gained the concept of a healthy lifestyle and action plan. The hardware of the health center is good  the courses are very professional  the coaches and mentors are great  and the staff is very friendly. || Everything there is wonderful!,
"I have been to this center only for dinner.||Two evenings a week  this vegetarian/vegan buffet dinner is served  a true feast of goodness  a mix of flavors from Thai  Japanese  Italian cuisines.||The kitchen is open and very clean  with two Italian chefs  Ivan and Ivano  fantastic  one of them  Ivan  comes from Romagna and prepared two ""piadine"" for me on the spot  just for me  a fairy tale  being able to taste something typical of his own region.||Very kind and friendly people  and you can feel the love for their work.||They showed me the menu which  just by looking at it  even though I was already full from the delicious food  made me want to order something else  a very well-presented menu visually as well.||I did not use the other services of the resort  but the philosophy is certainly very valid  aiming to offer weeks of physical and mental purification that range from massages to yoga to diet.||The resort is located on a little hill from which you can enjoy an excellent view  outside the center  immersed in perfect tranquility for the philosophy they aim for.||The restaurant is open to everyone  even those not staying at the resort.||Absolutely worth trying even if the cost is slightly higher on average compared to what you can find nearby  but the quality and service are definitely much superior.",
This place was just what I needed! I stayed for 7 nights and had the yoga program for 5 days including food  massage  and much more. I didn't want to leave at all afterwards. || The staff is really sweet and friendly  the restaurant serves fantastic vegan food - the desserts are also absolutely amazing! I'm not a vegan or vegetarian myself  but I was more than satisfied with the food and it just tasted so good!,
"We were in this magnificent yoga  relaxation  and restaurant center. It's worth coming here for this view. The view of the mountains and the sea is simply delightful. The staff is very nice and polite  speaks English well. The cafe is vegan and raw food. All dishes on the menu are affordable and understandable. Delicious and inexpensive coffee - only 110 baht for a cappuccino.Finding the cafe is easy - if you drive through the pass from Chalong to Kata - about 500 meters before the first turn on the map  there is a large white sign ""Santosa"" on the left. Turn at the sign and drive to the end of the street - that's where the whole center is located: yoga  detox  sauna  and restaurant.",5
We had a very memorable week here  detox  yoga  massage. I feel much lighter and have also started to love exercising. Thank you to all the enthusiastic staff  making my week of dieting not difficult at all  very happy.,
Amazing Detox Center on Phuket! Incredible Vegan / Vegetarian Restaurant and super cool classes! Will come back!,5
This condominium is a good option for people who love a healthy and balanced lifestyle  they are apartments that you can rent online. It is a quiet and calm place with a beautiful view  as well as a vegetarian restaurant (I have never been but they say it is expensive). There is a café for breakfast where the quality of the food is good although the portions are quite small  so if you have a big appetite  you won't be satisfied. I would rate it more like a light meal. They sell fruit salads and granola. ||They offer Pilates  Zumba  and Yoga classes in the mornings. They also have a shuttle service to take you to the beach in the morning and afternoon  and then bring you back to the condominium.||There is a small store in the condominium where you can buy basic items  but the selection is not very extensive. If you stay in phase 6  you should consider that there is a quite uncomfortable and tiring uphill walk for people with leg problems or difficulty walking  etc. There are no activities for children.,
I had a vegan lunch here. The whole complex seems very nice. If you like this kind of thing then it'll be perfect but I guess I prefer more casual places because I didn't like the fact that the waitress called me 'sir'; I would rather a friendly  less formal atmosphere where I don't feel out of place but that says more about me than it does about Santosa! The view was beautiful. I had the pumpkin ravioli and the Magic Forest smoothie  both of which were delicious. The prices are somewhat expensive by Thai standards (~200B mains  150B drinks) but still not bad at all and you pay for the view  the service  and the quality of food. I recommend this place and would go back,4
Here is an excellent cafe for vegetarians. Everything is delicious  prices are average. The view from the cafe is stunning overlooking the bay  especially in the evening at sunset. The staff is polite and accommodating. The downside is the distance from the beach  a taxi will cost around 200 baht. There were a lot of mosquitoes in the evening in June. They gave us repellent. I recommend this cafe.,5
I had to urgently run away from Moscow  my brain needed a reboot  my body needed an update  a drop of palm on the soul. || And here: wind in the hair  the best detox shake in all of Phuket  soothing music  sincere smiles of the staff  the loving gaze of the Big Buddha - that's how I would spend a week. Santosa gave my brain a good relaxation  and my body a healthy impulse. Such a wonderful mood of spiritual clarity  purity of soul and body I found exactly in Santosa! Whatever I tried here  it dissolved the worries of routine and the cares of everyday life. Healing the soul in yoga or dance classes  turning off the brain by spending a couple of hours with a book on the magnificent veranda overlooking the sea and the Big Buddha  replacing a heavy usual lunch with an amazing shake and a vegetarian salad  trying a relaxing massage  each day different  melting in the fragrant sauna and then quickly into the pool filled with ice. It's a pity that I didn't get to try the detox program  because I got to talk to those who did  and I hope to treat myself to it next time.,5
By chance  I met Santosa! I was a bit nervous when I started the Detox program  afraid that I wouldn't be able to stick to it and affect the results. But the outcome was surprisingly good! I lost two pounds in two days! The quality of sleep was excellent  following the center's schedule for exercise and relaxation. I felt energized! With a professional team taking care of everything for you  all you need to do is enjoy the sunshine  delicious food  and beautiful scenery! Following Santosa's arrangements  after the morning yoga class  there is a special one-on-one communication session to discuss the day's schedule. Every aspect fits very well. As long as you are at the center  no one disturbs you  but if you have any needs  the staff will quickly respond to help you solve any problems. The raw food restaurant was unexpectedly delicious! It gave me a whole new sensory experience about life and my body! The two days passed by so quickly. I must complete the seven-day experience next time! I believe there will be a whole new me! I highly recommend Susanna's raw food restaurant and various juices! Delicious and nutritious!. She is very willing to share her creations with you  and you will also have unexpected gains in maintaining a healthy lifestyle on a daily basis and taking care of your loved ones! Thank you  Colleen! Thank you  Santosa Team! See you soon!,5
I have been several times to Kata Ocean View where I have always appreciated the relaxing character of the place. Recently opened  I was able to enjoy the serene atmosphere and the high quality services of the Santosa Wellness Center. ||High-quality massages for a more than reasonable price. 2 hours of massage for about 20 Euros. We want more!!!||I also tried the Vegan restaurant. As someone who is a fan of more traditional cuisine  I was amazed by the taste quality of the dishes. The vanilla-mango cake.a delight. Even the house wine is good. Quite an achievement in Thailand. ||The whole place is elevated with a sea view. At sunset  the atmosphere is simply heavenly. A must-visit.,5
By chance  I got to know about Santosa Detox in Phuket and decided to give this program a try with a mix of excitement and nervousness. || Upon arrival on a red-eye flight  the center's driver had been waiting for a long time  and the tropical night was very peaceful. As the morning light appeared  Santosa on the hill of Kata made me both surprised and delighted  truly a place that makes one feel at ease  making me deeply breathe in the fresh air. || The following 7-day program thoroughly cleansed my body  with dynamic yoga  fresh juices  and a tranquil environment that made me reluctant to leave. || I sincerely recommend this place and program  as everyone probably has a different experience.,5
I spent 10 days in Santosa following the juice fast program. Very quickly  I felt good  light  and relaxed. The team is lovely  attentive  and very professional. It feels like home there. The sports classes are great  my favorite: the morning one at 7:30. Geti  the instructor  is very encouraging and motivating  and 1 hour of exercise right after waking up with the morning breeze is a dream. Sandra and Anna  who take care of the detox  are lovely  and Coleen  the manager  does everything to make you feel good. A shuttle takes you to the beach and downtown for free  it's really 3 minutes away. The juices are very good  and the vegetarian restaurant is delicious. I regret not being able to stay longer but I will definitely come back next year! Thank you for everything  I had 10 wonderful and very relaxing days to forget the Parisian pace :) Shirley (Paris  France),5
I was with a friend for 3 weeks in Phuket and we came across Santosa through a recommendation. || We liked it so much that we went to yoga 3 times a week  only had our massages done there  and the food and cooking class were a very good experience. || We never missed the Saturday buffet. I'm not a vegan  but the food was so delicious  I really didn't miss anything. || After looking at the apartments  we are determined to book ourselves into Santosa for our next vacation. Everything was great  including the super nice young team!!!! || Thank you very much,5
I really enjoy practicing yoga and pilates or fitball outdoors with a view of the Big Buddha! Thank you very much to Olivia and Getty for these classes  they are very inspiring! The staff is very attentive. There is a sauna  massage  I tried shirodhara - it's magic! I recommend everyone to experience this! Also  on the center's premises  there is a vegetarian  vegan  raw food restaurant with culinary classes every day.,5
Great place  nice cafe!,5
If you have any questions about coming here  just say yes. Your body will thank you a thousand times. The staff is wonderful. And the whole journey at Atmanjai is incredible.,5
Amazing staff   great amenities  delicious food and you can choose to rest or detox. If you like lazing around a pool /beach and getting pampered. This is it. Location got a 4 as the tide and distance to other things affects the experience.,5
I give you my personal honest opinion. The hotel and facilities are absolutely spot on. Very calm and relaxing atmosphere  chilling music around small size swimming pool. Rooms are cleaning each day. Unfortunately the location is not worth it this price. Of course the hotel is Beach front but there is no option to swimming because half of the day is the outflow and knee-deep mud. Breakfast is enough for Ladies but definitely not enough for the adult men. The hotel has exclusive offer for massages  spa but the prices are absolutely not acceptable. Exclusive but overpriced everything ( including meals)comparing to local offers. In poor Thai cafe you will got also fresh but big portion of meal. Massages are triple time more expensive than around . if you want to walk around you need to rent motorbike or car because close is very loud street without any attraction or green space to chilling.,3
The detox program here is amazing. every detail is carefully thought through and delivered by expert practitioners. Can’t recommend highly enough - my best detox experience ever,5
Absolutely fantastic place - incredibly positive experience and will be back for sure. All of the staff across the resort are lovely  the guests are all equally awesome and the programmes are packed full to ensure the stay is varied and never dull. Thank you for such a great start to 2024!,5
Very professional and very personalised experience.All staff are very helpful.Great reset of living healthy life.,5
The Atmanjai experience surpassed my expectations.ALL the staff were so welcoming   helpful and caring. Would highly recommend .,5
Great place for detox  very well organized and knowledgeable  friendly and informative staffs. Warm and cozy.,5
Excellent Experience. Very thorough detox by well trained staff that make it very simple.,5
Wow!! I left Atmanjai last week after doing 4 days of the Ultra Cleanse. I hadn’t done anything like this before and didn’t know what to expect  but all the 5 star reviews are true- I feel like my mind  body and soul have been nourished and I am already prioritising and protecting my well-being so much more than I was before. The staff are kind  knowledgable and inspiring and support you every step of the way. I just wish I could’ve stay longer! Thank you everyone at Atmanjai- I’ll be back.,5
If you sincerely believe in detoxifying your mind  body and soul. Atmanjai is the place for you! I was here in September 2023 for almost 10days (wish could stay longer) with my husband. The mentors and staff are so kind and helpful. They will guide you the best program that suits u.and also encourage you to listen to your body. Never in my life I imagined that our gut is actually our second brain. We totally focused on what we were putting in our stomachs and realised that 'a healthy OUTSIDE starts from INSIDE'. Everything was getting better and better day by day. sleep  mood  thoughts  feelings  emotions and so on 💖! It was nice to meet ppl who were regular customers there from different parts of the world. Yoga  massages  healings (reiki  kinesiology  trauma healing.to name a few!)   herbal steam and cold baths  colemas and lots more to do there on daily basis. Absorb all the positive energies here in Atmanjai 😊.,5
It was tough 10 days; eat well  juice 4 days  ultra cleanse 5 days; age maters. Lost 5 1/2 kg.,5
Atmanjai is amazing. I love the programme  staff and facilities. All the facilitators I tried have been excellent.,5
I just spent seven days at Atmanjai doing their Ultra Cleanse. To say I loved it is an understatement My absolute favourite part of the program was the daily yoga classes with Izzy - this is the first time ever I have enjoyed yoga and had fun doing it. The whole program was extremely well organised  daily massages were bliss and the staff were ALL - every single one of them - super friendly  welcoming and fully of personality I will definitely be going back in a few months probably to try their Eat Well program this time and get some raw/vegan cookery lessons.,5
Lovely place and amazing staff. We (me and my wife) stayed for 4 days and joined the yoga and fitness program. Feeling amazing after the program. Maria the fitness and yoga instructor is a gem !! She is the best we have seen so far.,5
Lots of care has gone into putting the program together  plus flexibility for your individual preferences. Mind and body nourished  highly recommend this life re-setting experience.,5
Leaving feeling healthy  refreshed and overwhelming joyful! The location  amenities  programme and by far the incredible support provided is second to none. Thank you for an incredible experience  and lessons to take forward. Recommend wholeheartedly!,5
Beautiful spot w ocean view. Problem is they get the orders sometimes wrong and take forever to make the food. I’m talking up to one hour with 1/2 full restaurant. So if you come one hour earlier than you want to eat that solves that. Also repeat the order 2 times as beef is not chicken.,4
I went with my friend Tina and didn’t know what I was up for. Doing the detoxing and yoga I found that it was amazing in the results that I ended up with. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to get better in the way they eat and exercising. It is an amazing program.,5
Awesome experience. Feel more energy and learned a lot about healthy eating and lifestyle. Big thanks to all staff in Atmanjai for taking care of me.,5
Just spent a fantastic 9 days at Atmanjai. The detox programmes are comprehensive but relaxing and all the staff are wonderful and supportive. I left feeling completely refreshed  full of energy and ready to maintain the healthy lifestyle! Thank you so much,5
Can't recommend this place enough. If you're looking for a complete detox program in a cosy spa - then it's Atmanjai. Well managed  well researched  with beautiful souls that feel like family.,5
Very nice atmosphere. The service is excellent. Beautiful sea view. I recommend spending evenings here. They offer massages.,5
Good place for relax and detox programm. Friendly  attentive and caring staff. Delicious food. But old rooms((,5
We really enjoyed the 3 days program ! People were very friendly  everything was perfectly cared for  from activities to food   health information  etc . The  spot   beach    surrounding  treatment ‘ lodges ‘ yogaroom   restaurant  swimming pool splendid! Very fine atmosphere. After the 3 days we felt better than ever before! We like that we got tips en information to maintain this way of life . So  people from Atmanjaj  thank you so much for this extraordinary experience! We wil never forget ! ❤️😘❤️,5
I recently spent 11 days at Atmanjai for an ultra cleanse. It was my second time and as before I can not recommend the the whole team enough. They are the most caring and knowledgeable team to accompany you on your health journey   whatever your goals are. My main purpose was to still my mind and clean my body and I for sure achieved that. Can’t wait to come back xxx,5
I cannot thank Atmanjai enough for the wonderful care they gave me. They went above and beyond to make sure all guests were happy. Amazing programs tailored to each individual. Special thank you goes out to Stuart  Izzy  Tang and Om for being amazing. xx,5
I’m not your typical ‘retreat’ or wellness retreat guy. However  it exceeded mg expectations and I am returning late Nov. I have recommended Atmaniji to two friends who currently there and having a wonderful time. The staff are great such Tang and Om to Stuart (who really looked out for me when had a personal issue) and Marco. The great thing is that the program works and the team care about your experience so much…. but it’s not too earnest or overly spiritual. They have a great sense of humour and no one takes themselves too seriously… which I appreciated. However  they do take the work and your happy experience very seriously. You’re also stay in a beautiful resort right next to the sea. Lots of programs to choice from and amazing vegan and non vegan healthy food. Great price  great people and great vibes all week.,5
We had no expectations when coming to Atmanjai but this place has everything you need to feel healthy and stress free again. The staff are incredible.very caring and helpful. We extended our stay and will be returning. Fantastic programs available and lots of flexibility to find what suits you best. We loved it!!!,5
Stayed 1 week (wish i could do more)  can't believe the fun and relaxation i've had whilst literally turning my mental and physical health around here. Accommodation is more than lovely  beautiful food and location. the staff are the best I've ever experienced.,5
In May of 2022  I visited the Wellness Center at Atmanjai in order to do the Ultra Cleanse detox program for two weeks or so. I have visited other detox centers in Thailand over the past eight years in order to complete fasting programs and I arrived at Atmanjai with both experience in this area and certain expectations. I must say that I was very impressed with all aspects of the Atmanjai program and in many ways  it exceeded my expectations. In terms of infrastructure  the resort offers very modern and comfortable rooms. There is a pool and socializing area next to the beach. There is also restaurant which serves a variety of local foods  as well as fantastic vegetarian dishes designed specifically for those persons participating in the fitness and detox programs. Atmanjai offers detox programs for all levels and tastes: from shorter  gentler programs to longer and more intense ones. The Ultra Cleanse program  which I did  was put together with great attention to detail and a focus on the needs of each person. It includes many services such as reiki  consultations  iridology  massages  spa treatments and other items which help to round and support the overall fasting experience. In terms of its detail  comprehensiveness and execution  the Atmanjai program was indeed the best one that I have experienced in Thailand. I must emphasize that the professionalism and kindness of the staff at each step made the program a standout. Without exception  the entire Atmanjai team worked tirelessly on behalf of the guests and with a genuine sense care and concern for the participants. Anyone choosing to do a program at this resort will be in good hands. In previous detox programs that I have done  which took place in more isolated environments  those detoxing had relatively little contact with non-detoxing persons. At Atmanjai  however  one should note that there is interaction between those persons who are detoxing and those who are not; that is to say  between those who are fasting and those persons who are on holiday. That facet of my stay did take a moment to get used to at the outset  but was quickly overcome. Whilst it was not a big issue  I would suggest that the Wellness Center at Atmanjai could improve this enclave of well-being by adding a quiet space that is reserved only for those who are fasting. Beyond that though I must say that Atmanjai comes with my highest recommendation. As someone who has taken part in many other detox programs in Thailand  the Wellness Center at Atmanjai stands clearly head and shoulders above the rest. The resort's meticulously prepared programs provide all that is needed for a successful detox experience. The kindness and knowledge of the skilled staff all make for a most enjoyable stay. For those looking for a top-quality detox center  Atmanjai is the place to be. Thanks to everyone there for a truly wonderful stay!,5
If you're thinking of going to Atmanjai then listen to your instincts and just go. I promise you won't regret it. I opted for a 2 week Ultra Cleanse and achieved a significant weight loss  dramatically improved BP and resting heart rate and a sense of mental wellbeing that it is hard to describe but suffice to say I feel in the best shape mentally and physically for a couple of decades ! The location is beautiful and the staff are simply first class. My heart felt thanks to Stuart  Yasmeen (soon to be managing Atmanjai Egypt)  Tang  Om  Ayleen  Banana and Jumpee . You all made my time so enjoyable and so beneficial  I owe you a debt of gratitude. I also want to mention the visiting specialists who provided both education and therapy. Particular mention for Marco  John and Simon. Thanks lastly to Izzy and for sharing some of your wisdom with me before I left. I'm certainly going to return.,5
The Spa staff so knowledgeable  helpful and incredible! My transformation after my 7 Day Ultra Cleanse is beyond measure Reset  Restore  Remarkable!!! Thank you Tang for going above and beyond and actually being you. And Stuart thank you for your guidance and the incredible advise you will be pleased too know that I have introduced to my daily life at home ( a small thing but including using small plates) The resort beautiful and staff are world class Namaste 🙏,5
Love this place. After the detox  my eyesight is clearer and colors are more vibrant. Lost good amount of weight. Their method is quite effective. Great support and service. And massages everyday? Simply heavenly!!!,5
This was my first detox program and my first time at Atmanjai. I have travelled across the globe  stayed at many hotels and resorts  and met people but never experienced anything like Atmanjai. It was a lifetime experience  and I highly recommend that everyone reading this comment go ahead and book it and come back and read further. From welcome to goodbye  people working here treat you with unconditional attention  love and care. The programs are very flexible  making me understand what works best for my lifestyle and goals. Special mention to my buddy/guru Stuart for the positive energy he carries throughout the day. During the entire program  he checked on me thrice  sometimes four or five times daily  to see if I was doing well and needed special attention. Special mention to all trainers and coaches  thank you for your insights and thoughts on health  life and nature. Food is divine here; Veg Lasagne is the BESTT!!! Timely juices and friendly restaurant staff just added to the best experience. Overall  this has been the best decision ever  and I will return soon to meet all my friends.,5
Just finished a cleanse This place is an amazing boost For good feeling and good health I feel great,5
Lovely program in a lovely place staff are amazing,5
First every cleanse and so glad I when to Atmanjai. I did 5 days on eat well (raw food was outstanding) and 8 days on juice. The results were amazing  with my blood pressure and weight both well down. All the team are outstanding and special thanks to Stuart  Yasmin  Om and Tang for their support during my time at Atmanjai. Would highly recommded Atmanjai and I will be back.,5
Great programs at a great resort Atmanjai is a beautiful place with great offerings of results driven detox and other programs. There a great sense of community and togetherness there. Also  their raw plant based foods are lovely. I would not hesitate to go back.,5
I have twice been to Atmanjai. The first was on the Fitness & Yoga Program in 2019 and the second time on the Juice Cleanse Program in 2022. I loved the whole experience. The atmosphere is relaxed and very friendly. The programs really work and are excellent value. If you come with an open attitude  you will be awakened in many ways. I gained so much from Atmanjai and I’m returning soon for more!,5
Where to start…I cannot speak highly enough of the whole Atmanjai experience  whether you’re coming for a full Ultra Cleanse detox  or like me the Fitness and Yoga Retreat  they really do cover all bases! The setting is beautiful  with an uninterrupted beach to spend quiet time…amazing massage facilities and treatment areas. Their staff are unbelievable and talented  with nothing too much to ask! Big thank you to Sham  my PT for my time at Atmanjai…he challenged me in ways I needed  regardless of my daily moaning! I’m so thankful for his positive and reassuring approach to getting my fitness back on track and he’s an asset to the team there! Morning yoga and deep stretching was also 5*  they have fantastic instructors! Another thank you to Stuart  who is positivity personified.I left Atmanjai feeling rested and reset  my exact intentions of coming here! And finally  the food - the restaurant is truly one of the nicest I’ve ate at while in Thailand; fresh produce  good portions and super healthy without feeling like I was eating like a rabbit! The staff were accommodating to any small daily menu changes I wanted to make! Once again  a huge thank you! I’ll most certainly be back!,5
The program  staff  and facilities have exceeded far beyond my expectations! I can't say enough good words about my amazing experience at Atmanji  and very much looking forward to coming back again x,5
I’ve been to Atmanjai a number of times over the past 10 years  primarily to spend a week on the Ultra-Cleanse as a reset and detox. It’s never failed to be physically and emotionally effective  and has always been made particularly special by the energy and love of the staff. This time was different though… I had planned on spending two weeks there  to rejuvenate after a rough couple of (COVID) years…. But after a week  I knew I needed longer. There were bigger shifts happening within me  and Atmanjai facilitated  allowed and supported these shifts. I stayed for five weeks and would have stayed longer if I could. I would recommend Atmanjai with my whole heart - there is not a single about the experience or program that I would change.,5
Best place for detox .feel so good,5
Natural,5
I did celebrate my 60th birthday in this beautiful hotel with this incredible atmosphere and a very nice Buffay cooked by a real chef with a super organization thank you Charles,5
This is a great place to be introduce to a Detox programme. Highly recommended.,5
I had a fantastic experience at Atmanjai doing Eat Well program. I loved their peaceful atmosphere  beautiful surroundings and delicious raw vegan food! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for ways to improve their health.,5
I recently returned from my 4th visit to Atmanjai. I seem to love it more every time I visit and am already planning my next visit. I love everything about it! The location can’t be beaten  right on the beach in a quiet and peaceful location in the South of Phuket  not far from one of my favourite beaches which we visit on Sunday mornings as part of the program. They offer 4 different programs and also flexibility. So you can actually chop and change even when you are there depending on what you are trying to achieve and your progress and your body’s response. All programs are the same cost which is why they can be so flexible. I did 10 days this time and I started with 3 days juice detox  6 days ultra-cleanse and one day eat well. The results were amazing! I lost weight and came away feeling fantastic. My friends said I was simply glowing! All the therapies are excellent  the staff are so warm and friendly and helpful and there are many additional therapies available at a very reasonable cost. I loved my daily massage and especially starting the day with yoga. The thing I love most about Atmanjai is the vibe. It is a completely non-judgemental environment where it doesn’t matter how old you are  where you come from  what you do or what physical condition you are in  there is such a feeling of acceptance by everyone  including the other guests. All the guests form a great bond and enjoying hanging out together and chatting in the sala in between activities. I cann’t recommend this enough. If you are looking for a place to improve your mind  body and soul as well as recharge  don’t look anywhere else. A big thanks to Izzy  Tang  Om and Jumpee for another wonderful experience. I hope to see you all again in a few months’ time. I can’t get enough of Atmanjai!,5
So special  what an amazing place!,5
Great experience  very friendly staff and informative guides. Very delicious juices and lovely rooms  next to the beach. :),5
This place is amazing aside from the great team who are experts in their own field. Here  I have learned to value myself and discover more about me. This is an experience that I will not forget. Looking forward for the next detoxification! Im so grateful to have this.,5
Hello guys thank you so very much for this wonderful experience. My 40th birthday at Atmanjai is a life-changing decision I made for my health and well-being. Special mention to Izzy  such an amazing person that you are. And the staff  Tang  Om and everyone else you guys are the best. I will definitely be back!!!,5
Nice set up quiet location,5
Very professional stuff and methodique. Everyone is taking care about you  thats really important when you are on a fasting program! Thank you,5
Best place to gain healthy body and mind. Lots of fun activities  good food  good facilities  nice beach and amazing people and support staff. Highly recommended.,5
Amazing Thai massage before leave the our hotel. We had complementary 45 minutes massage for hotel #friendship beach resort. The tai girl really made good job  massage was strong. the environment perfect.,5
wow. where do i even begin. this place is a mess. my best friend and i came to atmanjai for their wellness program for a week  both of us planning to do the “ultra cleanse” (all liquid diet) for most of the days with the option to switch to the “eat well” (raw vegan) if we couldn’t handle not eating. i arrived a day after my friend did and she was clearly very sluggish  pale  almost sickly. not even an hour into me being there she had to take a nap because she was so out of energy (it was 14:00). overall accommodation: walking into the room was shocking. mold everywhere  a make-shift shower  and a “no flushing toilet paper” sign next to the toilet. since i arrived past 7am  i didn’t get to start the program until the next day. for dinner i ordered pad thai and chips and guacamole (disgusting) and really confusing that they have things like burgers and fries on the menu of a resort that’s all about “wellness”. loud children everywhere. oh and smoking is allowed? the pool is bright green. the staff is so unaccommodating and slow  i literally had to walk up to the bar to get my bill after dining at a table near the pool. waitresses are no where to be found. all of the staff members look like they want to leave. just a bad vibe from a place that’s supposed to put you in a better state. oh yeah and the beach? NOPE! crabs everywhere. murky water and sticky sand. “wellness” program: the whole premise of the wellness program is that your current diet has coated your colon with “mucoid plaque” and that you need to clear it out in order to feel better. claiming that it even cures aids. after waking up at 7am to drink a psyllium + bentonite clay drink  we went to yoga then i got an intro to the program by tomas. he showed me a video saying that a doctor found “mucoid plaque” in peoples colons and that upon removal and an alkaline based diet all of your ailments will disappear. he told me it takes 3 days of the cleanse for the mucoid plaque to come out. for the ultra cleanse program they have you drink psyllium husk + bentonite clay in water 5x a day and have “colemas” (similar to a colonic) 2x a day. after the intro tomas showed me how to administer a colema to myself. THE PAIN. the entrance of the tube isn’t painful but having your colon irrigated with 14L of coffee water is!!! he said it wouldn’t be painful  maybe cramping but nothing else. when i tell you my body and instincts literally told me to stop  i’m not kidding i went into fight or flight mode. i could tell i was hurting myself. after my colema i asked my friend how hers was  and she said the same thing. my feces turned from normal to literally undigested food because of the colema. i had extremely harsh bowel movements afterwards. i felt like i was going to faint. i did some research on colemas and mucoid plaque and guess what!!!! ITS TOTAL BS! doctors deemed it quackery YEARS AGO. there’s a reason colemas are only practiced in thailand!!!! and - to make it even better - “mucoid plaque” ISNT EVEN REAL. it’s just the bentonite clay coating your colon after drinking those shakes 15x. that’s why they said it takes 3 days for the mucoid plaque to come out. i informed my friend. we both were scared. she was starting to get sick. we stopped the diet and ate food and informed the “wellness” program staff (presley) that we were going to do the “eat well” program instead. she talked to my friend in the most condescending tone and said “are you sure you want to do that” - like  what?!! aren’t you supposed to be a support system for the clients visiting? that made my friend so uncomfortable we decided to leave early. upon leaving - my friend gets a text from the person that referred her telling her that she knows we left atmanjai. PRESLEY LEAKED CLIENT INFORMATION! the manager DOESNT CARE! can’t believe that a hotel would share client information. suddenly presley is “busy” and can’t talk on the phone. called the manager and he just yelled at us for not finishing the program. LOL!,1
Fantastic place for a detox and a holiday break next to the sea. I went in March this year for a 9 day Ultra Cleanse detox and was very impressed with not only the results I achieved but the professionalism of the resort and all the staff. I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants to do their body and mind a big favor and at the same time lose weight and feel great at the end of it. After a week or two here it will kick start you into a new healthier lifestyle and help you maintain good health into the future. I plan to go back once a year for a tune-up and a reminder of what I should be doing all year round. A special thank you to Presley and Thomasz  you were both great and very helpful. Oh  and before I forget did I mention Presley? she is an asset to the team  they are lucky to have her! Folks  look no further  I don't believe you can get better than this place for a detox and the cost is very reasonable for what you get back in return.,5
I've tried to book at Atmajai but no rooms available so the stuff booked me at Serenity resort  500meters walking forn Atmajai. For a person looking for a relaxing retreat this is definitely not a good solution. Serenity resort is absolutely the farest thing from a relaxing environment you can imagine  food Is poor  no toothpaste in the bedroom (apparently it doesn't come with the room  you have to order it)  laud guests  people smoking in common areas and no one checking that rules are respected  it's a very average hotel pretending to be a luxury one. They allow guest form outside to enter the hotel facility (not the most classy people enjoy this service.) The walk to this location is on the side of the main road and it is not pleasant at all especially at evening  but Understand Atmajai staff suggest it only because ownership is the same. I am sure with a room at Atmanjai my experience would have been more positive but the stay at Serenity ruin my experience. I did the yoga and fitness programme  it is noce but it doesn't wirth the money in my opinion.,2
I love coming to atmanjai to disconnect with the world and reconnect with myself,5
Excellent food and restaurant staff.,5
Excellent massage very relaxed now,5
The yoga and fitness program was exactly what I needed  and all of the extra pampering was amazing. The staff are wonderful and the food is spectacular!,5
I just visit the Spa from the Hotel  which was under my expectations. The price for a Thai massage or a back and shoulders massage is 707Bath. The lady who did the massage was friendly  but the the price of spa were really high in comparison to other spas in Phuket. The spa areas are not so beautiful and clean as it is in other spas in Phuket  besides they don't have many options for spa treatment.,2
Not worth the money. Went here for the intensive cleanse. A lot of pseudoscience. What they don't tell you is that there will be people staying at the accomodation eating mexican and burgers  bags of chips and beers. Plus kids running around the whole time. Left 2 days early because of this.,2
Don't tell me  okay.,5
4 star detox centre   Attentive and friendly staff   facilities need upgrading   very reasonable pricing if you get a 40% discount good choice of 3 -12 days programs,4
Well planned detox. Everything is organised. Staff friendly and helpful. Place is clean. Good place to go for detox,4
Great sea front view with great food.,5
One of my Favorite place in Phuket !,5
I was there in January- took me a while to write a review. It was the best detox place in Thailand ( I have been to others in ko panghan) this was by far the most professional environment. Incredible program. The staff members were like angels- I can’t recommend this place enough. I am very much looking forward to my return.,5
I had the best experience at Amity during my maiden wellness retreat in May  2024. I had found them online in March and had to make some adjustments to my original dates due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts. Throughout this process  the staff (specifically Jordan) was very responsive and accommodating. The pre arrival communication was very clear and when I finally reached Amity  the welcoming staff made a great first impression. I did a 7 day detox program and being my first time doing a program like this  I had a lot of anxiety. Once I settled in  I quickly realized that I was in a global community of like minded strangers supported by world class staff members. The facilities are excellent and the team on site patiently answers everything with a smile on their faces. Michael  Palida  and the rest of the team are super knowledgeable and eager to form a connection with each guest. There is an expansive list of therapies and group activities that keep you busy each day. The kitchen staff are superb and the raw organic food surpassed my expectations. The housekeeping staff would have fun with my faux travel dog and leave him with a new creative animal shaped friend each day. It was a joy to spend the time at Amity and I am looking forward to returning later this year. If you are considering a retreat in a perfect location with world class facilities and superb staff members  then look no further!,5
Best place to clean your body and mind!,5
The team is extraordinary  location fabulous and the program options just perfect… I have been detoxing with Michelle and her team for 4 times now and I can’t wait to go again  exploring this beautiful spot. Just the best investment I could make for myself,5
Infinite gratitude. For the growth in consciousness and what is possible for myself and humanity. Do not hesitate book go enjoy,5
Great team  vibe and results. Highly recommended. With love. Diman,5
FANTASTIC! The best present you can give yourself. Nourish your mind  body and soul. The team at Amity are more like family  nothing is touch trouble from the the minute you are personally collected from The airport to the moment you leave. The whole experience is faultless. You can fully cleanse or have a programe that is best suited to you  the consultants will let you know what is best for you. everyone is different. Everyone one is helpful  management  cleaning staff  kitchen staff  consultants  massage therapists  yoga teachers  visiting therapists. It's no wonder I have now been here 3 years in a row and have booked my 4th. Highly  highly recommended,5
Such a lovely place. Price is so reasonable. Staff are nice. Food is so healthy and in big size.,5
Amazing experience! Professional  caring staff  superb services and exceptional therapies and therapists. Amity is a place for quality self care  healing  detox and where you can optimise your health. Highly recommended,5
Love this place and wish I could go twice each year!,5
"More than 5 stars for me! (Feedback below)- Lost 2kg in 5 days without feeling hungry- Waist reduced by 3cm (feels even slimmer)- Daily morning yoga and fitness time refreshes both mind and body from the morning. Realized that exercising in the morning is good.- Meditation and chatting with friends during daily meetings are quite soothing.- There are mental health and psychological seminars. Could objectively see where my weaknesses come from.- Can easily go to the beach in free time  but it's nice not to have to go (don't have to follow a set program)- Daily schedule is decided daily  so I don't have to think about anything (I think this is quite important)- Daily 1-hour massage makes me feel very luxurious. The lady in charge is very soothing.- Daily colon cleansing is tough  but it really feels refreshing. It's a chance to review my eating habits. Learned a bit about cooking  looking forward to meal preparation from now on.- Literally detox from the outside and inside. There are oxygen bars and pods  and you sweat a lot.- Participating in herbal sauna and ice bath with friends while enduring is quite fun. Usually  I do things alone  but at this time  we help each other. It's impossible to stay in the ice bath alone for 5 minutes.- No need to push yourself. No need to rush. It's nice to be able to decide on various plans not just with ""YES/NO"" but also with ""maybe"".- Staff responds flexibly with a smile to various requests. No guilt because they don't make you feel pressured.- I used to drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day  now I'm surprised that I don't even feel like drinking it.",5
Amity is magnificent in everyway and most especially because of the people who run it. I try to get there at least once every 12months. They are totally flexible and can tailor things to suit your individual needs. Do as much or as little as you want.,5
A true healing center at all levels. All is well organized to make our detox easy and efficient. The Amity Wellness team always trying to give us the best experience possible and meet our personal needs. The food is excellent and room superclean. Thanks to you all! I will go back for sure.,5
It's been years since I was at Amity Wellness and had a great experience. now that Thailand has opened  I cant wait to spend wellness retreat there again. The programme suits me well  Im looking forward to my visit again.,5
If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Palida and the team are sweet  knowledgeable and so kind. You instantly feel like family. If you are on the fence honestly give yourself this gift and book! I know I’ll return one day. Thank you Amity team forever thankful for the mind  body and soul reboot! X,5
Simply the most caring  hygienic  professional  educational  effective  and fine tuned detox program you’ll find anywhere. They are so good at what they do that I had to beg them to take my money the first few days. All the other places require in advance and they don’t refund it Once paid. Amity is so friendly and confident in what they do that they forget to even take your payment until the third or fourth day! I had to keep reminding them. They are so focused on providing a world-class detox program and they are so friendly and so deeply caring- there are no words to describe. This is one of those hidden gems that when you find it you return again and again. I have been there three times and during Covid they were shut down - I desperately spend over 80 hours trying to research other detox programs that were open and nothing even came close to their program. No one offers the discipline of A massage and the inflammation pod and the vitamins and the super foods and the colema every single day. Most places will offer just a fraction of that stuff and just a few times in a week. But when you do the Amity program you realize why you need certain things every day. I can’t praise them enough and I’m usually very critical of the services and goods that I consume. You can’t go wrong with them - just go ahead and look at their TripAdvisor reviews they’re all five stars! I promise you I’m real and I promise you those reviews are real - if in doubt  go visit one time and you’ll see for yourself!!!!!,5
I have been attending Amity Wellness since Shell opened the doors and have been coming back every year (well almost every year) ever since. Shell and the team have created a first class experience for their guests  that makes it such a wonderful place to keep coming back too. I highly recommend Amity Wellness to everyone I speak to who values their physical  mental and emotional well-being. You won’t be disappointed and I guarantee you will be thinking about booking your next cleanse holiday before you even leave! My friends and family all comment on how much I am glowing after each time I return from Amity - no need to sell it to anyone when the results make you glow from the inside and out! The team are all fantastic  you feel like a member of the family straight away. Everyone is extremely knowledgeable and experienced so you know you are in safe hands every step of your cleanse journey. The food is incredible  and the daily massages are an added bonus! No need to look anywhere else  this place is by far the best in its class!,5
Stayed 6 days for my first time in Aug’22. Loved the team there  always so friendly and engaging. Loved the food there  everyday is a surprise & yummy food. Loved the location there  easy walk for sunrise. Loved the daily programs  everyday is so busy! Highly recommend for everyone.,5
I have just booked my 3rd Visit to Amity and I am also bringing my sister with me this time. I cannot express my gratitude enough to the team at Amity. I always leave inspired  motivated and glowing of health. Thank you Amity Team and I look forward to Feb 2023!,5
I heard about Amity through word of mouth from a friend who visited and decided I would go. It was the most amazing experience I could have ever hoped for and I seriously can't wait to make Amity a regular trip. Michelle and her team are phenomenal and maintain contact and offer regular support to visitors which really does go above and beyond. I do beleive they really care and have a passion for what they do. Everything is exceptional from the food to the extra curricular classes and even as I was leaving I saw how meticulous their cleaning was. I saw duvets mattresses and pillows being cleaned which blew my mind about their attention to detail. But again their food  is delectable and needs another shout out. The resources you leave with to continue your wellness journey is wonderful as well.,5
Background. 6'4'' male  131.6kg starting weight  overall no medical issues  fairly healthy  rarely drink alcohol but drink 3 to 4 litres of Coke Zero daily Why Amity: I came across them via google searches and it looked very unpretentious. I'm not a vegan  I'm not a yoga person or overly spiritual. I didn't get the vibe from the website so I contacted them to make a booking. The Experience: I went with the intention of doing a full fast for 9 days  but when I got there this changed (mutually so). Days 1 2 8 9 was going to be intermittent fast  and Days 3 through 7 consisting of only 2 juice and one smoothie. From a dietary perspective I was very surprised at how very little hungry my body felt the entire time. I felt I got stronger as the days went by and by day 7 I was bouncing on my toes. No doubt helped with the coke zero toxins leaving the body  but also because of the friendly happy vibe from both the staff and the group of fellow cleansers I found myself with. Activity wise  I liked the Inflammation pods (pretty much a personal infrared sauna tube)  and the walk around the lake during the sunset beach trip. morning classes were varied and fine. Night market and shopping centre trip also gave different stimulus The Results: much clearer skin  bouncing with energy  -5.6kg in 9 days (mostly from the first 5 days) and an appreciation to distinguish between hunger and appetite. Would I repeat: I never thought about repeating prior to going. but yes  I could see myself going again to get away from things and right my body should I need it again. and I would have no hesitation booking Amity. This from a big burly bloke who doesn't enjoy yoga and likes eating meat. So to the other guys out there  don't discount the idea of a cleanse  it works wonders.,5
Stayed at Amity for just over a week and it was a fantastic experience. The staff were so supportive  approachable and knowledgeable. The accommodation is incredibly clean (cleaned everyday) and the rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. The daily activities and talks (eg cooking demos  detox talks  walks etc) were always well organised and delivered by specialists. The message lady Miss Tia was amazing! I was on the intermittent fasting programme and the juice fasting programme. With hindsight I should have stayed on the IF programme because the food was sooo good! I would highly recommend Amity  don’t hesitate just book!!!,5
From the minute you're met at the airport with huge smiles  seamlessly led to your apartment to relax before the formalities and intro begins  you already know your first time at Amity won't be your last! As I got to know the other retreat go-ers  I also learnt the majority of them were repeat business  this speaks volumes. The Amity team make you feel like family  pampering your every request. I opted for a simple raw food plan  although many others were on juice cleanse or full fast  yet no one ever passes comment on being hungry  because its so well designed! I lost a whopping 3.1kg without even fasting. The facilities are immaculate  and the daily tailored schedules are as per your preferences too. It was hard to leave on day 9  because I could have stayed weeks! Yet I left refreshed  nourished  with a spring in my step  with new found friends  and 2 friends had already signed up for their amity experience on the back of my reviews. You will be back. Again and Again. So take the first step now!,5
Amity retreat is beyond PERFECT. I have been on many retreats. This one made a huge difference. The love the care the services the staff the therapists the FOOD is next to none AND beyond EXCELLENT. I’ve spent 12 of the best days ever  I feel brand new with a new vision moving forward for my health and well-being. Thank you Michelle Palida and staff for GREAT HOSPITALITY And making this available to us. Absolutely FAULTLESS. I will be BACK very soon and spreading the word to friends. Thank you thank you thank you. I’ve not felt this good in a long time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AMINTY.❤️❤️❤️,5
Firstly a huge Thank you to Palida and your team at Amity for going above and beyond your call of duty to make this happen for me. I had an awesome 3 weeks and literally smashed my goal. Couldnt be happier.. unless i could stay longer in this resort of smiles. If you are looking to Detox or simply treat yourself to a Health Retreat for some well deserved rest. The team at Amity take the pressure of everyday life  off you. You have a simple program and an array of daily activities you might choose to do. You dont have to be anywhere or do anything  its a real escape from everyday life. One might say Bliss in a Bubble. An all inclusive resort to rest and restore,5
Been there twice. Will be going there for many more times! Wonderful staff  full of love.,5
BEST DETOX EVER If you’ve never done a cleanse before read this! I have so much admiration for all of the Amity team. I can’t thank them enough for their heartfelt love  support and kindness I received over my full fast for 9 days. From the thorough booking procedure right through to the explanations about the colemas. Everyone is super knowledgeable and really has time for any questions or queries you may have. This is the fifth time I’ve had the pleasure of participating in a fast with the Amity team. The last time was about two years ago. I approached this fast with a goal of “resetting” my mindset and creating a more mindful eating regime. This is exactly what I achieved over my time spent at the retreat. Every day we were all met with cheerful happy faces ready for any questions or queries that you may have. There’s always something to do if you would like to participate. Every day there’s a different choice of activities  classes  trips and in-depth chats about your health and wellness. The retreat runs like clockwork. When I left I was so sad to leave. It was like leaving a family behind. You get to mix and mingle with the other lovely guests and everyone really supports each other over their time spent at the retreat. When you leave you really are prepared for how to take care of yourself and make healthier life choices. There are weekly raw food classes which I absolutely loved and took home a wealth of knowledge. It’s been little over 6 weeks now since I finished my fast and I have tried numerous recipes from what I learnt at Amity. I feel wonderful  energized and positive and most of all I feel a new lease of life. Thank you all again at Amity for your kindness  support  genuine love and care over the days I spent with you. I miss you guys and will be back. Much love  Lisa XoX,5
This is my third time to Amity and first time on a full fast. I came in needing a physical + emotional + mental reboot and I got Exactly what I came in for. The calming and loving environment made my full fast so easy - in fact  I only broke it cos I needed to readjust back to reality! So much love and thanks to the team! Hoping to keep in touch with my fellow fast mates :),5
Amity wellness resort has a perfect environment for detox. The staffs and consultants are well trained  programs properly scheduled and nutritions properly administered. A must visit if you're looking to detox or just as a retreat from a hectic lifestyle.,5
The rain is very heavy.,5
Amity wellness retreat is a wonderful place to detoxify your body after living a fast paced life in the urban jungle. There's tons to keep you occupied while you detox making the experience all the better  from massages  saunas  swimming  meditation and coconuts. There really isn't a better place (at least in my opinon). Head over to amity for a incredible enlightening experience surrounded by what feels like family.,5
Michelle and her team mended me when I was broken,5
Every detail is taken care of. My experience at Amity was simply perfect. Absolutely amazing !!!,5
An excellent detox experience with lovely staff and heaps of information to give your body and mind a complete reboot. Highly recommended.,5
Quality Thailand Detox center!,5
If you are looking for a place for Detoxing and Fasting in Thailand  then I recommend Amity Wellness :),5
I had one of the best massages here. It was super relaxing and strong enough to release my muscle tension. I fell asleep twice during the massage.,5
Highly recommend visiting for your wellness  this is paradise. Staff and surroundings are amazingly helpful and friendly   especially Jose   Pongwitch/Miki  Karn  Fern  Noy  Nat and Sai and Nina and Goong.,5
My partner and I had an amazing facial at 180 wellness spa located within absolute twin sands resort and spa in phuket. Our therapists Nina and kae made us feel so welcomed. They served us beautiful drinks and ginger tea upon arrival and after our treatment. The ginger tea is the best I've ever had. The facial was so relaxing and we had our feet  shoulders and head massaged while our face masks were setting. Truly a 5 star experience especially as we took advantage of their 2 for 1 Monday deal! The price was so affordable we booked ourselves in for some amazing massages aswell. Far better than any of the small massage places you will come across. A must try if you are in the area.,5
The staff are very friendy and atmosphere is nice. I had my nails painted and 2 massages over my week stay. I highly recommend Any's Thai massage. It was sensational.,5
Kae Was Phenomenal. Had The Best Massage And Adapted To My Body,5
We returned for another one hour massage yesterday. Again  Mui  Karn  Any and Nina were wonderful. Thank you guys! My wife and I had 60 minute full body massages  myself by Any and my wife by Karn. They were amazing! Also  Nina the Manager was so courteous  friendly and welcoming. Thank you  it was such an enjoyable experience for us both.,5
Great relaxing and soothing wellness spa and massage,4
The service was amazing. Had a fantastic massage from the masseuse by the name of Koi. Would highly recommend this service if staying at Twin Sands Resort & Spa.,5
I've been to many spa's worldwide and the foot massage at 180 Wellness was up in my top 3. Absolutely sensational.,5
Relaxing treatment,5
My wife and I had a beautiful massage. We were treated with refreshments before and aftrrwards. The Thai ladies massaging were Nui and Wi  and they were excellent. We floated out of there!,5
Aroma Facial was magnificent. Nina done such a wonderful job. I was so relaxed and get a great time. Thank you very much.,5
1000 Thank yous for the great service  great healing and for squeezing me in under such short notice. I walked in here with a 80% migraine attack and walked out with very little pain and feeling extremely releaved and a whole lot better. Jee attended to me and she was absolutely magnificent.,5
Fabulous massage by Nui and Wi. They managed to work out our tired muscles and we felt so refreshed and invigorated afterwards. Highly recommend their skill and professionalism.,5
Nina was very skilled and the Thai herbal compress massage was fantastic.,5
Amazing service from masseuses (Karn and Nui). Facial massage was very relaxing. Back massage was fantastic. Will visit the place again! Mona & Norman 🥰,5
Ping and Nui both absolutely amazing massage therapists. They managed to fix all pain in my knee and back I was having.,5
Ping and Nui were absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! They literally hit every spot that was tender. I highly recommend a visit to this salon. Thank you so so much ladies for an awesome massage and experience.,5
We had Royal Thai massage with Ying and Nui  they are very professional and put the right pressures on my body  really recommend the service at 180 wellness,5
More comfortable and cleaner than the massage shops outside  I am completely satisfied. Thank you to the two massage therapists  Nui and Jee.,5
If ever you are after an incredible massage in a clean and professional place  180 wellness at Absolute twin sands resort and spa is the place to be . In particular ask for a lady named Nui . This lady has strong hands and fingers that seem to majestically glide over every muscle you never knew existed with kindness and effort . Loved it so much going back again tomorrow! Thank you,5
Professional and relaxing,5
Wonderful experience at the spa. We had repeated treatments by Jee and Nui and thoroughly enjoyed each one. We can't wait to come back.,5
Deep tissue massage professionally done by Jane. And well done relaxing massage by Karn. All amenities are sterile clean.,5
Thanks a lot to Nina and Karn  they are very thoughtful. We enjoyed the massage and we recommend to go to 180 wellness.,5
Excellent Thai massage and facial by Jane. I think it is the first time someone got rid of my shoulder knots!,5
Enjoyed an absolutely fabulous relaxation massage with Nina A. She is amazing I can’t wait to have another. I would fully recommend Nina and 180 Wellness centre for a wonderful experience.,5
Karn and A were very professional and skilled and it was a truly relaxing experience. It's definitely a step up from the massages in town.,5
Great facility with great friendly service. Good variety of treatments.,5
I just experienced a euphoria of stress release from A and her team at the spa. The experience was incredible and A’s professionalism showed as she provided me the most relaxing body massage you can ask for  her experience showed as she was detailed and observant to areas of your body for pain release. It was an incredible experience and every cent I spent at the spa was worth every penny. Yes you can go into Patong for cheaper but why cheat yourself from having one of the most relaxing massage you could ever have. Her professionalism is more than comparable to a Registered Massage Therapist in Canada. Make sure you communicate with her and tell her what you want. I always had a combination of Thai and oil massage. The spa and facial treatment was on par. The cost is higher then being in the town but what do you expect as it’s in your hotel. The staff was very friendly and they made you feel very welcomed. The hotel itself was at par of a 4 star but die to being closed for the last 2 years there were some minor hiccups that the hotel was able to fix immediately. The reception area staff by Min and her team was always professional and treated you with respect which you should to as a custom in Thai. They greet you with a smile and will take care of your stay. Don’t be tough on them as all of the workers worry very hard and to try to make your stay enjoyable. The pool is clean and the hotel was as good as any other hotel in the area for reopening after 2 years of being closed. As for the restaurant the breakfast was good but the eggs Benedict that I had the one day I found the bread a bit stale. As for the rest of their food I was impressed with their food at dinner and their pizza they made was. As good or better then most pizza places in Thailand that I had. Great job to the team of this hotel they deserve a pat on the back for the wonderful stay I had at this resort and which I could of stayed longer. The only downside of this hotel was the ride into Patong beach 2.7km it is a bit winding corner and the roads are a bit rough to the hotel as I rented a scooter from the hotels affiliate partner which was very professional and reasonable they did not cheat me and I was very happy with that as a lot of scooter rentals in Thailand tend to rip some customers off. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want peace and quiet.,5
So Amazing and wonderful massage service staff very professional and friendly good place to relax,5
Very professional and well trained masseuse. Excellent experience,5
Very Nice place  nice yoga  smoothies and salad is fantastic :),4
So nice  exellent treatment  very nice personal. We can really recommend this Spa!,5
Riktigt skön massage och trevlig personal.,5
The oil was very authentic. And the whole session felt great. You can ask for Lek/Tim i think they are one of the best,5
Maya the yoga and meditation teacher is just wonderful. She has a lovely calm voice and is very encouraging  regardless of how much yoga you have done in the past. The poolside location is perfect.,4
AMAZING massage. So nice to find a spa on the island were you get real quality treatment. I went with my girlfriend and she cannot stop raving about her nails. Tea and relaxing by the pool afterwards was icing on the cake!,5
Tik was amazing the time taken for a manicure then French tips. Haven't had such an awesome nail technician in a while.,5
Great place to stay for holiday staffs are nice and friendly helpful ! Delicious good!

Before I came I was scared cause never flight but Trainer make me feel comfortable   get energy and power   He's very nice guy . I'll go again cause I need to be stronger  faster and healthier.,5
Very friendly staff. I had a 30 minute salt scrub followed by a one hour massage. They knew I was jetlagged and let me snooze in the massage room for an hour after I fell asleep during massage - priceless. Lots of different services  clean  reasonable prices  somewhere you can feel comfortable to take family members. In the Absolute Twin Sands Resort which has great restaurant we ate at also.,5
First time of Thai Boxing Class for me and my friends so fun the trainer was wonderful!,5
Relaxing and Wonderful Spa!! I had a wonderful experience at the wellness center .The atmosphere is clean and tranquil  and the massage therapists are kind and skilled. Highly recommended!,5
There are many fun activities to do  such as Muay Thai  Zumba dance class  and dancing with the instructors. It's so much fun! If anyone is traveling near Trat  I highly recommend it.,5
I am a returning client from Hong Kong  went here the 2nd time earlier this month. Last year I did the bliss spa programme for a week. The hotel staff and wellness staff never fails to amaze me. They are very attentive to details  and always smiling. Teachers in the wellness programme are very devoted to teach us their art and culture. I think I will come back after a few months again!,5
Here is very nice place. Wellness and spa was amazing  a lot of fun activities (Thai boxing  Pilates  cardio dance zumba dance).Khun Nadia  wellness manager is professional and kind she can help to you to decide the best program during stay.,5
"Love this place friendly and knowledgeable staff Thanks Nadia for the great health tip after ion foot spa ""you should not miss it""",5
During my stay at Let's Phuket I've tried several massage procedures and was very pleased. Friendly staff  good prices if special packages are used and professional spa specialists.,5
My daughter and I had the pleasure of being guests at the Absolute Twin Sands Resort and Spa for a week where we relished in the Spa Bliss Program with their 180 degree Wellness Centre at Phuket  Thailand. From the moment we arrived  we felt welcomed  cared for  listened to and understood. The accommodation is extremely clean  modern and comfortable and set in a peaceful location away from the hustle and bustle. There is a free courtesy shuttle to take guests into Patong Beach if you wish. All meals included in our program were fresh  nourishing and delicious. The exercise program was flexible and suited to individuals. The various and numerous spa treatments included facials  massages and foot detoxes! These qualities can be found in many successful resorts and spas around the world but what sets the Absolute Twin Sands Resort and Wellness Centre apart from the rest is the people. No doubt they are experienced and knowledgeable. In addition they are also genuinely caring  supportive and gentle with each individual. They don’t use high pressure tactics to push people beyond their limits. Instead they motivate  encourage  support and guide. We are grateful for the awakenings  lessons learnt and new habits formed at 180 degrees Wellness. We look forward to returning at some stage and continuing our journey towards better health and vitality. A big thank you to all the team.,5
Hot Yoga every morning  amazing food  a lovely and totally knowledgable team  relaxation  meditation and the retreat accommodation is the best I have seen in any Thailand wellness retreat. All round a very worthwhile experience.,5
Just that distance from the hustle and bustle of Patong to command complete relaxation. We enjoy morning yoga class that we decided to go back the following days. Extensive ranges of wellness programs to choose from.,5
Excellent results on detox and weight-loss programs,5
Will not offer day passes  friendly staff but will not give you a day use option We came specially to try it and were outright refused. This makes no sense as a business It doesn’t matter how nice the staff are   if you can’t use  only get to see it   it kind of makes it worse. I hope this review makes them reconsider,1
What a great way to start my fitness journey in beautiful Thailand. I was fortunate to spend 8 weeks (11/23-Jan 24) at Phuket Fit. I met lots of great people from all over the world made new and lasting friendships. We all had one goal in mind and worked together to achieve our individual fitness goals. The location is walking distance to the beach. some of the top reasons for choosing Phuket Fit:||||1. Number of classes that all fitness levels can participate in. For someone who is older  not as fit and needs bilateral knee replacement surgery. My advice is that if I can exercise 3-4 hours a day  anybody can do it. Do not be intimated by the program irregardless of age or fitness level. ||||The trainers did a great job during the classes and was able to either modify or give me different exercises (due to my knee issues). I loved the aqua aerobics (taught by Chain one of the trainers) as it was a fun way to start my day. Every week there were hikes ”Beach” workout day and weekly social events. There was also a gym (with a/c) that was available to use.||||2. On-site Housing. It makes a difference just walking to classes and having the opportunity to go back to your room rather than being offsite. The rooms were large and my bed was comfy. Again Carl (Manager) took into consideration my knees and placed me closer to the entrance  rather than to walk upstairs to my room.||||3. Cafe - It was a pleasure not having to decide what and when to eat everyday. This program gives you consistency and makes participating easier. The menu was extensive and nobody went hungry. You were provided snacks  fruit  coconut water protein shakes during the day as part of the program. There are tons of restaurants within walking distance if you need to get out for a change of pace.||||4. Pool. I’m a water baby and loved the pool. It was a fantastic add to the program. Several of us spent time in between classes socializing and hanging at the pool (multiple times during the day). it was utilized on rest days. It gave us another outlet to not only to relax but keep active. ||||The PF staff from the trainers  front desk  Cafe  maintenance and housekeeping teams made my stay enjoyable (I won’t start naming names and leave anybody out). They worked really hard at giving us the best experience and did it with a smile -everyday. It is the staff at PF that made the difference in my experience.||||I had a great experience and lost 9kg at the same time. I was given training methodologies to take with me and utilize on my own. ||||I researched retreats for several months and this program  hands down gives you the biggest bang for your buck when compared to similar programs around the world. Please take the word of a retired CFO living on a budget. ||||As a solo traveler  I’ve only been gone a month and I miss the routine /socialization of being at Phuket Fit. I may be back sooner than planned.,5
Great to back at PF for the first time since COVID. All of the old positives are still present: very social  fun atmosphere  proper training. Some areas have improved notably the focused weights classes with great supervision  the new pool and the restaurant. Excellent visit  hit my goals  met some lovely people. Highly recommended!,5
I had an amazing experience at Phuketfit  the only downside is I wished I had booked longer than just a week! Very smooth and professional staff starting from booking with Carl who responded quickly to any questions and assisted with my booking. Was greeted by Cherry and the other very friendly reception staff who gave us a tour of the wonderful facilities. Restaurant staff were also so helpful and genuine the food was great and the menu had every item's calories and macros listed to help you. Effe and Derrick were also exceptional coaches  encouraging everyone gently while also pushing you to maximize your workout. Facilities were perfect too  room clean and comfortable and having classes/swimming pool/indoor gym/restaurant all within one location was so convenient. Phuketfit is located in a very nice quiet part of town too so it's really perfect for a retreat. A 7/11 is located right across the street for any necessities you need to buy and there are many walking trails in the area too.||||Overall a flawless experience that I can't wait to repeat!,5
Excellent value  great location. Effe and Chain the trainers very good and will keep you on your toes  they will work you at a pace comfortable to you.||||Girls in Restaurant and Front Office lovely and always willing to help  even the maintenance staff fixed my rented Car Bumper. ||||The owner (Liam) top fella  quite busy as you’d expect  but always available every time I’ve been there with many many years experience in the industry. ||||Overall to get to the point they’re at so quickly after Covid is down to the drive and determination of the owner being the same as it was 10 years ago.,5
Great place for detox and weight lost. Profesionaly managed,5
Wow  what a life-changing experience! I went to PhuketFit not completely sure it was the right thing for me. I Was 80 lb overweight and something needed to change. I was concerned that the boot camp part of PhuketFits schedule was going to be too much for me. But I'm so glad I did it. I feel like I got 10 years back. The staff are amazing the food is incredible. I want to give a big shout out to the training staff  Effie  Chain  and Derek made a huge difference. Completely supportive  very educational  always making sure that you don't hurt yourself. The food changed my eating habits and it has been one month since I left and I'm still eating the way I was shown. If you have any hesitancy like I did just go and give it a try there's something for everyone. All the other guests are super supportive kind and generous. Best time and money I've ever spent.,5
I had an outstanding experience at Phuket Fit. The service was excellent  and the staff demonstrated unwavering dedication. The weight loss program was not only effective but also personalized. I managed to shed 7 kgs in just 30 days  providing the kick start I needed on my fitness journey. I am sincerely thankful for the transformative experience they provided. The fitness resort proved to be a melting pot of positive experiences as I made friends from diverse countries and cultures. The communal atmosphere added an extra layer of enjoyment to my fitness journey  creating lasting connections with people from around the world.,5
Was here in 2014 for 2 months. Great experience. Good food and staff. Not really a quick walk to any attractions but still a nice location.,4
I have just spent 3 weeks here. Learned a lot about fitness and nutrition  had a truly excellent time and was pushed carefully but harder than I thought I could go. The staff  trainers  equipment and facilities and training are excellent. The pool and grounds are really well maintained and the whole place is very relaxing. I highly recommend coming here. I won't consider an alternative after such a brilliant experience. My only minor complaint is the mattress in the lovely rooms are slightly too firm. That's it that's the only thing I could grumble at. Great work guys!! See you again soon.,5
Had a great experience at Phuket fit  would definitely come again. It is a gem of a health and wellness experience. The meals were healthy and delicious  the staff were all friendly and welcoming. The fitness classes were a rewarding experience. I left at a lighter weight  feeling more energized  more toned  happier  and tanned! Would definitely come back again.,
It was an amazing month long fitness journey here! This was my 2nd time back at Phuket Fit and I’ll definitely come back again next year. The staff is super friendly  the classes are great and accommodation is good. I love that the restaurant is on site which is very convenient and makes healthy eating that much easier. The location is close to beaches and things to do but not in the middle of it all  so that was nice. Overall  a great experience and I would recommend!,5
My journey with the PhuketFit Transformation Program has been nothing short of life-changing. This program promises to enhance fitness  skills  and enjoyment – and let me tell you. It surpassed all my expectations!||The classes were exciting and challenging  from strength workouts (my personal favourite) to agility training  catering to all levels. I really enjoyed the Private Sessions  which meant I got to customise my workouts with choices like Strength Training  Yoga  Pilates  Mobility (a lifesaver for my sciatica  with trainers adapting exercises)  and even Muay Thai boxing (a game-changer for my cardio and conditioning). I also loved that there was an on-site Gym and Pool  which I also used daily.||The trainers weren't just trainers. They were motivators  and they really cared for your well-being and loved seeing and praising improvements week after week. Their supportive  cheerleaders and push you through your limiting beliefs to get you through your training sessions. You can push more than you think.||The journey was truly inspiring. I wanted to fall back in love with fitness for someone who used to train all the time to nothing at all  it worked  and this was my first holiday in 7 years.||Beyond fitness  this program offers more than you can ever imagine  I have genuinely made some lifelong friends from all walks of life and from all over the world  I understand why people come back year after year  and I can wait to return  I loved my 3 weeks.||A Special shout out to:||Manager: Carl - Your leadership ensured everything ran seamlessly  and your meticulous attention to detail was evident on a daily basis. Thanks for your local knowledge and assistance especially with directions lol and for being so approachable.||Reception: Chain  Cherie  Jida - Your warm welcomes and assistance made me feel very welcome on a daily basis.||Housekeeping: P'Ree  P'Naang  P'Ngiam  Gluay – Thanks for keeping my room spotless and creating a cozy home away from home.||Restaurant: P'Ae  Fah  Peach (cooks)  Jai (Head chef)  Jane  Nana  Natalee (waitstaff) - Your culinary magic nourished not just the body but the soul. The food  Protein shakes made sticking to the macros easy  especially using the app.||Gym  Fitness  and Wellbeing Trainers: Efe  Chain  Nong  Gee - Your expertise and motivation reshaped more than just our bodies  and the Edu Fit classes were great.||Gardeners: P'Wat  San Lwin – Thanks for creating serene surroundings and tranquillity.||Pool/Engineering: P'Ball  P'Tu  Phong – Thanks for taking care of the pool and the seamless operations to ensure a flawless experience during my stay.||To all of you  my heartfelt thanks for making this fitness journey and my holiday unforgettable and looking forward to seeing you again soon.,5
Loved every minute  if i could have stayed longer i would have! ||Before booking my trip i exchanged a number of emails with Carl  he was very helpful in providing information for the trip  time scales & costs. ||I had arrived the day before check-in and took the time to walk over just to have a look and say hello  Cherie on reception gave a me a full tour of the facilities. ||I booked/attended specifically for the weight-loss program. On day one i was weighed  photographed and given a readout of my current weight breakdown including percentages of body fat  visceral fat & muscles mass. ||There were classes every day  in varying forms. Wed & Sun are rest days  however Phuketfit still run classes such as HIIT & Zumba for those that want to continue their workouts. There is also a (air conditioned) fully kitted out gym  with free weights and modern equipment that is open daily if you'd like to add any further workouts to your stay. There is an Edu-Fit class each day where you have the space to talk to the trainer and they'll guide you through the process & science of weight-loss  muscle gain & maintenance. Overall  you can do as much or as little as you like. The choice is yours! ||The food was lovely  i really enjoyed the choices. The Menu is broken down into selections that show you the breakdown for Kcals  Proteins  Carbs  Fat & Fibre. This enables you to choose food that fit the allocation provided to you in your first Edu-Fit session. This is explained in detail as the class take place. Its not a strict regime  no-one is going to slap the food from your hand if you choose to have extra carbs. however i felt as though i was provided with enough information to make the choices that mattered and would affect my weight-loss in a positive manner. There is also a dispenser of Electrolytes in the restaurant that you can help yourself to  grab a glass and go! ||All of the staff were lovely  couldn't do enough. Accommodation was lovely. Phuketfit arrange free transport (to & from) various night markets on Sunday and have a sunset walk on Wednesday. ||As a pale white English man  i had to wear factor 50 sun cream most days! Beware of the sun/heat  especially on a clear cloud-less days! I know this is common sense  however. be careful. I did burn  even covered head to toe in factor 50! I also used a '50% deet jungle spray' that i bought from Amazon  everyday. This helped keep the mosquito bites to a minimum.||The main trainer Effie is great  motivating and knowledgeable. He helped me train hard  whilst instructing me in ways to train my previously injured knee to strengthen it. Shane is great also  i believe as of July23 he's shadowing Effie as he trains. There was always good banter in the classes  good jostling and encouragement. If you cant do something  talk to the trainers and they'll find you a suitable alternative. ||I have high hopes to return next year  Phuketfit has left quite the impression on me.,5
Great attitude towards the customers 👍 very helpful well done,5
I would like to be back here. Unfortunate  it is close now. Hope everything is back to tourist city like Phuket soon. Then I will definitely see all of you guys,5
Want to restart your life. Go here for 2 weeks and have a real go. Results are not easy but will come,5
Terrible experience here. Management was horrendous. I had $900 usd stolen from inside my locked safe. I was just one of many guests to be robbed at the same time. Management was completely unresponsive and just put us all off until we had to leave the country. Our entire last week spent in police station. Detectives said it was 100% the fault of Phuketfit. Broken security cameras  broken locks. They had agreed to re-pay HALF of the stolen money but  then simply didn’t. I have all the signed documents by owner and CFO  and all the police reports as well. They simply Stopped responding to emails & WhatsApps. We have a whole GROUP of us who had money stolen still waiting for months. I feel so bad for the wonderful employees who have to work for the horrible management team & owner. Do not go here - sometimes “the cheapest” isn’t the best way to go. If any little thing should go wrong for you  just know that you will be ignored  and completely on your own. Management is abusive and unreliable.,1
Typische Mutai Schule,3
Worst Experience Ever! Terrible counselors that just didn't care. Only 3 of the cheapest vegetables available for 'fitness and health' resort? And to top it off  I had money stolen from my LOCKED SAFE and the security cameras were conveniently broken. Management just didn't care and tried to make me sign a non-disclosure agreement. NO WAY would I sign that. It's more important to me to tell the world what happened to me. DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE! It is not safe!,1
Great program and friendly staff. Highly recommend,5
"First of all  5 stars for the Thai staff  they are lovely  warm  and helpful. The airport transfer was on time and went well. Contrary to the information on TripAdvisor  the transfer is free one way and 1500 baht for the return trip (according to a fellow athlete  mine was included in the overall cost). The return transfer was 20 minutes late  the driver was on the phone the whole way  and after an hour asked me which airport I wanted to go to. Day 1: The reception was manned  everything was ready  and I was taken to the FitBX accommodation. First  you sign about 30 pages of prohibitions (drugs  alcohol  smoking  using pool towels  PhuketFit is not liable for accidents  etc.). This dampens the mood. FitBX accommodation: the newly modern clean Room 9 is located between the main road and the sewage canal  hence the smell and noise. You don't feel safe. At least it was possible to switch without complications after one night. During the 4 weeks I was there  everyone except for a couple and two individuals moved to PhuketFit or Navatara. Walking distance (leisurely) to PhuketFit is 10 minutes. Rooms at PhuketFit: very loud air conditioning (compared to the massage room or dining area)  either fully on or off  no temperature control possible; very hard bed (and no  it's not just my feeling  I slept on the 5 pillows)  room service is good  no daily shampoo or lotion  instead  even the clean towels are replaced. Occasional cockroaches. Shower is lukewarm or cold. Mold on the bathroom walls. The fridge is not cleaned  food leftovers unchanged for 1 month. The TV is just decoration as the reception is so poor. Also  the door locks are easily breakable  the hotel complex is freely accessible  and there is no night watch. After the receptionist was shocked that I walked alone through the ""dark dangerous"" Phuket from FitBX to PhuketFit on the first evening  a strange feeling of security at night. Hotel facilities: contrary to what English native speakers have taken from the advertising  NO sauna  no steam room  a 2x4x1.5 meter pool (estimated)  the pool in the advertisement belongs to another hotel which is a 10-minute drive away. Likewise  the sauna and steam room are accessible by car at a neighboring hotel. The entire facility is not well-maintained  especially the area around the pool. In need of renovation. Paint peeling off  etc. Also  the moss mats in the fitness area are discolored and dirty. The gym is tiny  some weights are rusty  kettlebells too. The steam room is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by 12/2019. Located between the toilet and the boxing ring  so I think I could have used it myself. There is no relaxation to be found in this place. Partner hotel. Transfer included. Thai Palace - beautiful large pool (2) and great surroundings. Spa at Ton Mai - cannot be called a spa  my gym at home has 10 times more spa facilities. There is a small pool and a small steam room. The fitness test consists of finger-to-floor distance  plank  wall sit  ball throw  and squat. The test is theoretically supposed to be repeated at the end. However  since it is stopped after a maximum time of 2.5 minutes or 30 repetitions and my finger-to-floor distance is less than zero  a repetition is unnecessary. Ultimately  about 90% feel they are at Level 2  only if you have a BMI of 45 and no idea what a squat is  you get Level 1. The ""consultation"" and personalized health test are conducted by someone who has studied tourism (not a nutritionist). The test involves stepping on a scale. A bit too much body fat is normal because I am a woman. But since you can specify your gender on the device  I am above the norm  so the first contradiction. 1400-1600 kcal for a woman who wants to lose weight  build muscle  or do total fitness  and the same amount of protein? And my expectation to lose 1 kg in 4 weeks (he laughs)  he would expect up to 8 kg. In the end  it was zero kilos retrospectively. His recommendation is a maximum of 3 hours of exercise per day. I mention that I currently (on sabbatical) do 6 hours of exercise and will not do less. So far  no woman I have met has lost more than 1 kg in 4-6 weeks. The guys  sure. But not the girls. Although I was asked at the reception if it was okay to take ""before and after"" photos of me  here it is assumed that I really want it. Restaurant: Incorrect information regarding calories (e.g. 67 kcal instead of 11 kcal per spoon) and ingredients (fiber by 2 orders of magnitude). Very nice attentive staff  mosquito spray is free. Water is available throughout  as well as an electrolyte drink (however  no secure calorie information here). The quality of the food varies depending on the chef on duty. The advertisement stated that there would be food according to your own diet  but as a ""minority"" like vegans  keto  etc.  it is difficult and you have to know your own concept as there is no support. Furthermore  it is difficult to reach your protein intake without cottage cheese  feta  etc. Calorie counting is impossible as the bowl is sometimes full  half full  or half empty. Thai boxing: THE 2 trainers are hardly understandable  the gloves smell awful (newly packaged ones have been lying around for 2 weeks)  and the daily 2x1.5 hours always run the same and it cannot be said that they are motivated. For example  a hangover from the previous evening leads to shortened training. 10 minutes of running  10 meters of jump rope  10 minutes of stretching  then boxing in the air  boxing on the bag  and in between push-ups  sit-ups  and maybe 2 rounds of boxing with a trainer. If there are two people  it is shortened to 45 minutes. Classes: Zumba - Russian instructor without rhythm who forgets her own choreography and should attend a fitness camp for conditioning. Still very nice and fun. Zumba itself is officially ridiculed by the trainers here and not recognized as a sport. Aquafit: even the trainer doesn't take it seriously  and it's not strenuous (it could be made more fun and challenging with foam dumbbells  etc.). Classes - Noi  Boy  Kam. Depending on the trainer  more or less fun  effort  and variety. Generally  very unfit overweight people can do little (weight loss program)  for those who want to do ""total fitness "" you get resistance if you do 5-6 hours of exercise per day because ""it's not healthy"" and if you did that much  ""you wouldn't be participating properly"". Even if you have the same exercise routine at home. Posture mistakes are rarely corrected. Little variety. FITBX classes: Varied and most challenging  motivated trainer. Unfortunately  only 3 vouchers for 1 hour per week. Beach: the proximity to the beach is correct regarding FitBX  which is a 7-minute walk away. And it is not a swimming beach. Yanui Beach is a 15-20 minute walk away  Naiharn even further. Excursions to the night market  light festival  etc.  are well organized and free. Bike rental works  free  but return is only possible until 5 pm due to lack of light. ||| In summary  a nice fitness camp with room for improvement.",3
Authentic Marocan food at an incredible price. The Tajine with chicken lemon is recommended. In fact all is very nice  inclusive their couscous. Real home cooking.,5
I tried it with my partner and i felt it is overly priced for what they offer. Not for me,4
Good camp in rawai,5
Phuketfit is a fantastic  welcoming and fun fitness resort with all inclusive packages to detox your mind & body and get your fitness back to top shape. They have an excellent team of professionals that will aid you on your journey and help you achieve your goals. Highly recommended!,5
Awesome,5

Great whole of body & diet concept. Would love to stay for a month,4
"I was misled by all the 5 x star reviews on this place and decided to come here above other options. Accommodation is drab and not worth the cost taking into consideration other nearby locations - most of the place should be really be knocked down and reconstructed. The entrance to 3 x bungalow rooms had a broken lock  one shower couldn't turn off  had issue with the safe in another room. There's an imbalance of quality sincerity and integrity in the staff with an obvious vacant management oversight and structure. I also experienced an issue of distrust from the reception staff when attempting to purchase a mere singlet and come back wearing it for next class shortly afterwards with my wallet to pay. This was offensive especially considering the singlet was a fraction of the over 50000 THB I had already spent there and left a sour taste in my mouth at departure. I was pleased with elements of some of the classes. The detox and diet program was the best part of my experience. Hi Anthony  In response you your email: I am not sure what repairs you checked on but the lock I was referring to was the frozen rusted lock on the external glass door of the bungalow leading to the three rooms despite being both handed keys for that lock that doesn't even turn. Why even give guests keys to this lock that doesn't work? The safe key for room 22 didn't work so staff member took it off my set of keys. I didn't get a replacement and didn't bother using the safe. Room 21 safe key was ok. First night and shower in room 21 the shower wouldn't turn off. Had to get complete handle swapped out - yep by one of your ""mysterious"" maintenance people. It was replaced by a shower handle older and more worn than the faulty one but at least shower could be turned off I cut my leg twice on the very sharp corners of the glass table in common area in front of rooms 21 and 22. I told 3 different staff members about this and showed them the cuts received to left of my knee that I can still even see now - over 2 weeks later. Please run your finger against each of the 4 x corners of the glass table yourself. You'll see how dangerous they are. They are almost as sharp as broken glass. I moved the table away from the couches up against the third room door which was at the time vacant to avoid hitting it again. Chris commented the same when we first arrived. If you haven't seen anything logged and staff are not reporting anything verbally to you when you've asked them then please see my note in original review re: questionable sincerity and integrity of some of the Phuketfit staff members - the only other option you can be implying is that I must be making all of this up? My experience was not all bad and not all negative hence the 3 star rating which equates to ""ok"". I chose this as a balance of my good and bad experiences. In fact if I didn't stay in the overpriced outdated accomodation I would have had a much happier time. Your various class trainers  Selena and detox area people were enjoyable  helpful and excellent to deal with and I would agree that that subset selection of the overall staff are indeed as you stated: ""really prides itself on going the extra mile to help people transform their lives"" Daniel",3
This place lacks polish or good structure. If all you require is classes to attend  Phuket will be more than fine. If you require direction  or are seeking feedback  accountability and a complete program this is not for you. I have done more than half a dozen programs across Australia and Asia. This is a good budget program. Poor accomodation  stay elsewhere in Rawai Beach  much better value and there is no real advantage staying on premises.,3
Loved my time here. Didn't want to leave. Such friendly people and great muay Thai training and training in general,5
Didn’t stay here and not saying the place is bad  but no casual / guest entry??? Seems like you’re missing a lot of potential market on a town primarily built on tourism. Bit annoyed being away  just trying to get in a good workout  and happy to pay. Didn’t need the attitude from the 4 people at the front desk messing around on their phones when I came in to ask.,5
No BS this place does exactly what it says it will do. Educate you  exercise you and get you fully aware of how to continue with your nutrition. 3RD time back and seeing the benefits again already.,5
PhuketFit is my go-to fitness and detox retreat! They offer a whole range of quality services all under one roof. From a detox programme  to weight-loss and fitness programmes. They have the most amazing food  fitness classes  trainers  staff  accommodation  massages and so much more! Couldn't recommend this place enough!,5
Love this place,5

I stayed for a 10 day detox program in Sept 15 and that has transformed the way I eat and exercise,5
What is it?,5
Amazing experience  with amazing coaches and very beneficial programs,5
PhuketFit is such an awesome place! Amazing people running the show right from the reception staff  cleaning Dept  restaurant staff  gym helpers to the very talented trainers. It was an unforgettable stay for three weeks. I was living in the pool side deluxe room which was quite large and included a separate living area. Start your day with early morning session of Muay Thai  Pilates  Aero fit  Aqua Fit  HIIT  TRX  Athletic Development  Muay Thai and finally Yoga to end the day. You end up investing time and energy with like minded people with the motive of achieving a healthier lifestyle  weight loss  an overall improvement in your physical fitness levels. The restaurant has a very well charted menu including calorie counts for all the items from omelette  bacon sandwiches  pastas  Thai delicacies  burgers  and much more all made to perfection and healthy alternatives and completely customizable to ones preferences ultimately keeping the calorie count under what was instructed at the beginning of the program. However I must point out one of their outstanding trainers Noi Kaewpradit  a young thai trainer who takes lead in various excervlcises programs  Pilates  Aerofit  Aqiafit  HIIT  TRX and Yoga. He was very very helpful throughout the stay and went beyond the call of duty to ensure I achieved my end objective. I think his energy is quite infectious. Brilliant chap and will look forward to seeing him in the future along with all the lovely staff of PhuketFit. Anyone who travels to Thailand should seriously consider coming down to Phuket and trying this incredible program at phuket fit. It's truly life changing. And in case you plan to kick-start a program at PhuketFit do not forget to visit the beautiful lake about 2-3 km (walking distance) from PhuketFit right next to Nai Harn Beach (the cleanest beach in all of Phuket and is hardly ever crowded). Also try out the Greek and German restaurants right next to PhuketFit awesome healthy food options! PS I lost about 5 Kgs during my 3 week's stay!,5
Everyone at Phuket Fit was friendly and professional. My coach  Dmitry was wonderful  he would check on me almost daily and make alternate suggestions  depending on how I was feeling to help me accomplish my goals. The front desk crew was also great  very helpful and friendly. Pop  Mookie  Ob and Ko were all amazing. As for the cafe staff Chai was my favorite. He was super personable and remembered all my perferences. Ning the manager of house keeping was so sweet to me  she woukd ask me every day if i needed anything for my room or if my room had been cleaned the way I liked. I had my clothes out to dry one day. It started to rain while I was in a class. I assumed my clothes would be soaking wet by the time I returned but much to my surprise I came back to find that Ning and her staff brought out some drying racks and moved all my clothes underneath the eve to dry outside of the rain. Such a pleasant surprise. Over all a great experience and I was able to accomplish my fitness goals  while making great new friends  in a beautiful place and having lots of fun doing zumba (with Gabry)  yoga (with Noi) and of course Muay Thai (with Jack  Knee  Mas  and Sitruk). I would highly recommend for anyone looking to detox  loose weight  or get more fit.,5
Used the gym as guest  200baht per 2hrs entry. Hammer strenght weights  different machines  1 rack  kettlebells upto 32kgs  some cardios. Good aircon. could be blocked sometimes by the group courses. Will go again during my stay at the Navatara Resort just opposite the gym,5
There are exercise machines  a ring  and a yoga room,4
I pushed myself hard this time on my program starting with a full detoxification and then into the total fitness program which has been upgraded a lot since I was here last. Looking forward to next time because every time I come there are great improvements; really liked the new cooking classes and education  the swimming pool was also fantastic and the new trainers even better than before. Great job to everyone  thanks for all the support!,5
After taking the 14 day Total Fitness program at Phuket Fit  I must say that I am unbelievably impressed. My research all started a couple months ago prior to a trip to Thailand. I stumbled upon this place while doing some research and figured it would give me an incredible opportunity to get back in shape  while at the same time experiencing the culture and Thai lifestyle. Going into this program I was in moderately healthy shape  but my diet was poor and I needed to tone my body overall. This program completely kicked me into shape! The first few days were difficult and challenging  as time went on I felt more rested  more energetic  and stronger. It is absolutely incredible how effective this program was. In the 14 days I was able to get my body back on track and lose a few pounds of fat. In addition  I feel stronger and have a much more effective routine and diet. The staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly  I absolutely loved how supportive they were and truly believe in the program that they teach. Thank you for the incredible experience during my trip to Thailand  I look forward to returning in the future.,5
I’ve been to a few different camps and retreats like this before yet none that had such a wide range of facilities  services and programs. It’s really cool with all the different options doing detoxes and then doing Yoga and then eating from the healthy food menu  followed by rejuvenation practices like all the oil massages and saunas  drinking coconut juices and loads of cool stuff. I’ve already recommended this place to my friends and plan to come back next year!,5
It was really fun  I learned a lot  I met knew people  I laughed and had a great time. My program was with detoxing and with fitness training  as well as many fun extras like herbal saunas and massages. I had a great time  thank you!,5
I absolutely love to travel  explore and try new things  I love anything fitness related too  which is why I jumped at the chance to accompany my friend who was traveling from the states to Thailand for weight loss and getting back in shape. I joined and started with a detox and then went on and did a fitness camp. Awesome.,5
The detox cleanse was AWESOME! I had done like juice cleanses before but this is so much better with the raw cleansing  the detoxing metals  detoxing the liver and colon  and also the wildcrafted detoxes and cleanses  it’s really well put together and your body literally goes through a cleaning process as the detoxification progresses. Really awesome. Thank you.,5
Ok lets start at the beginning. I searched for Bootcamps and was happy to travel anywhere in the world for this. PhuketFit came up on top on the Google search and the reviews were good. So I emailed them and got a reply within minutes. All correspondence were answered promptly and were friendly. So I booked it and payed the deposit. On arriving at PhuketFit it struck me immediately how friendly the reception staff were and they full explained what the 2 week weight loss program involved for me. The accommodation was basic but fit for purpose. I had a minor flood in my room after heavy rain and the staff acted on this quickly and moved me to the Baan Suan bungalows which were amazing. They are not part of PhuketFit resort yet but will be later in the year. So if you want luxury accom go for Baan Suan or the Novotara across the road. But the rooms in PhuketFit are ideal. The detox cleanse 5 days was tailored well and there was always something to do like Sauna  Coconut water  Liver drink (yuk). I didn't really feel hungry during this but I didn't do any intensive training just Yoga and Pilates. The raw food in the Detox house was amazing  it was filling and incredibly tasty. After the detox I had lost 2.5kg but felt great so I started going to the intensive classes. All the trainers were highly skilled and top of their game. I lost another 3kg in 3 days and I was eating well; Burgers  pasta  omelettes. The Chef in the restaurant was amazing and the service staff were so friendly. Everyone was very supportive and all the staff couldn't do enough for you. I was lucky that I met some awesome people there and we all bonded really quickly which made the whole experience all the better. All in all it was a truly amazing adventure and I lost 8.4kg in weight in 13 days. I learned a lot about fitness and nutrition and about myself. A truly memorable experience and I would highly recommend it if you want to shed some weight or tone up. I was genuinely sad to leave after my 2 weeks and I will definitely go back again I loved the place  the people  the atmosphere. Thank you so much to everyone at PhuketFit for making this so amazing for me.,5
I did a fitness & Yoga retreat with my mom and dad when I was in Thailand a little over a month ago. We all had a great time  my parents did the detox program  while I was more interested in doing the Yoga and other fitness classes. All had a great time and wanted to share our thanks!,5
Great time  very good instructors.,5
This was a great healthy retreat for the mind  body and soul. You are able to relax your mind and enjoy the scenic view of the beautiful island and beach. For the body and soul there's Yoga and Pilates along with a wide range of fitness activities/packages such as Zumba  Thai boxing  Active Cleanse Program  Body Cleanse  Weight Loss and Detox Treatments. PhuketFit left me with an optimistic and positive outlook on my overall health. The staff serves as excellent support system offering advice  inspiration and encouragement. They also provide great recipes to help you stay fit.,5
I needed to get my fitness together and turn a new leaf so booked the detox + fitness package which really combines all the services they provide into a neat little package for a full overhaul. The detox was fabulous  far better than expected  and the fitness program was simply awesome. Lots of things to do the entire time  action packed in a good way  a lot of fun!,5
The detox program for me was like having a weight lifted that I had carried for some time. It’s amazing how we can carry burdens and yet not even realize it until it’s suddenly lifted from our lives. The detox was fun  renewing and has my recommendation.,5
I hadn’t been focused on my health for many years and I was in need of a good tune up. I started with a 5 day cleanses and then went on to a total fitness program. I was there for 21 days and wish I had booked 28 because I very almost did but thought it would be easy to extend at the end. The only problem was when I came to extend it was all booked up so instead I booked for January for a return visit. This place is great but books up much faster than I thought!,5
I haven’t given a review for anything for a couple of months now and I like to give them when they are justly deserved. In the case of my program at Phuket Fit camp in Thailand  I feel compelled to tell everyone I meet  my friends  my family and everyone about this place because it’s an experience I will always remember. I had actually never been to a camp like this before but I certainly shall be coming again because it’s really lovely to detox and just simply let go of everything and relax every once in a while. Letting go of all the stress and just allowing yourself to enjoy feeling healthy and energized. I had a wonderful time and I shall return.,5
Keeping my skin and body young and healthy is important to me which is why I detox every 4-5 months  usually I do so here in America but as I was traveling to Hong Kong decided to try a detox center in Asia this time instead. After searching through Google it was clear that the best place for me was PhuketFit because they run an “active cleanse” which is more what I am in to nowadays. I like moving while I’m detoxing  all the sitting and detoxing is not for me anymore  in fact  it shouldn’t really be for anyone because movement is essential whilst cleansing. And that’s really what I like about this place  it is a modern detox using scientific processes and cleanses  adapting an active approach for flushing  cleansing and detoxing. It is superb and highly recommended.,5
Even attending for just a short duration of 7 days  I got a really good feel for the place  the staff  the coaches and the overall atmosphere. It was very refreshing and in those 7 days I went from feeling slightly run down and tired  to being clear headed and rejuvenated. It was a great time for me to reset and I feel far better for it!,5
The new total fitness program they’re running now truly is a full life and fitness overhaul! I had done the old total fitness program and thought it was great then  but now with the additional aspects  such as cooking classes and education as well as the emphasis on renewing and revitalizing in combination with the fitness classes I know and love  it was even better! Looking forward to my next trip and hoping for more improvements!,5
Loved my experience at PhuketFit overall  had everything I wanted the TRX sessions  the Zumba Fitness and the Dance classes  I did Pilates classes  some kettle bell training  it truly was a total fitness experience! Impressed.,4
Detoxing being such a big thing nowadays I decided to try it when I was in Thailand last. I had seen PhuketFit before when I was going to rawai beach and thought it looked kinda fun. I looked online an saw that it was the main place people went and had many recommendations so decided to join. At first I was feeling really good on the detox  but then I started to feel a little bit down  I spoke to one of the detox consultants and she said it was normal and gave me some broth and a herbal drink  in about 10 minutes I was right back up again and feeling really good again. After that I continued to feel really good the remainder of my stay and after researching it turns outfit dip I felt was actually part of the detoxification  it’s almost like a withdrawal symptom  and you just feel so much better afterwards!,5
Excellent! Thank you to the team  special thank you to Kate!,5
Amazing experience for me and a few family members thanks so much for the great break :-),5
The camp is made up of sections all with specific purposes and corresponding to stages in your program. I started at the detox retreat which had a nice swimming pool and was really beautiful  I ate raw foods everyday and going to Yoga classes  Pilates and also I did a TRX session too while on my detox. At first I thought TRX would be only for advanced people  but what’s so cool about this place is that it’s mostly for beginners  I’d say at least 85% are rank beginners. This is good because it means the atmosphere is relaxed and completely non-intimidating. I love how everyone just got along and we were all doing similar things and all to get healthy so it was really nice. After the detox  I was on a delicious healthy foods menu with all kinds of selections  I really loved the food! And the classes were so much fun!,5
Joined for the new active cleanse program because I had been before and completed the mind & body cleanse and enjoyed the revelation and relaxation. But this time wanted something with more classes and activities so when I got an email from Kate about the active cleanse I booked the same day! Had a great time as always but was especially fun with the added activities this time! I’ll be back again of course…,5
I highly recommend the total fitness program it’s great value for money  includes delicious food which had me feeling fantastic  the classes are varied and really fun  the trainers are OUTSTANDING and the guests were all easy going and there for the same reason I was. I attended a little over a month ago and am really happy with the results.,5
I first did a detox holiday in Thailand years ago and thought it was great. Then a few months ago I researched again and was going to go back to the same place I went last time in Koh Samui  but PhuketFit was so enticing that I ditched those plans and travelled to Phuket instead. It was very different to my first detox experience and it was actually much better because the detoxifications included were far more extensive  there were many many more classes and other funs things to do like nutritional education classes  the healthy eating and cooking classes  and many more fun things.,5
Came with two friends and did a fitness retreat for 10 days  the trainers were really great  the food delicious  all three of us got great results from our programs.,5
Me and some girlfriends flew in from the states to come here for a 28 day program for weight loss and for me  a fitness program. The training can be tough if you start with the intermediate classes but I stuck to mostly the beginner classes at the beginning and near the end went back and tried the intermediate classes. I was shocked by how much fitter I was by taking the intermediate classes versus the beginner's classes. I think with the nutrition  rejuvenation  and of course the training itself  makes it really fast to get fit. I've kept it up now that I am back home.,5
Mostly came for fitness training but I also started by doing a detox too because that’s how the program I chose was structured. I didn’t really know what to expect with the detox because I didn’t really know what it even was before I started emailing with them. Anyway  it turns out that the detox flushes out your gut  and it’s funny because my gut was actually feeling a little cramped or something  after 4 days on the detox  completely gone my stomach felt a good lot lighter! I actually lost 2 kilos on the detox which was 5 days in total  I then went onto the fitness classes and everything which was even better for me  the whole thing in fact was very very good. I want to come back every year like many of the other guests who I spoke to have been doing. It’s just difficult for me to get away  but I definitely would come even every 6 months if I could!,5
Had an awesome time! It’s really cool how everything is done for you in the program so you can literally just go to your classes  eat your meals  do your massages  herbal saunas and everything and it’s all in one neat program. Really cool.,5
I really liked the boxing training that they have there  it’s a lot of fun because it’s the Thai variety so you’re using entire body. It’s called Muay Thai and when I looked into at first it looked and sounded really hardcore like only really fit  really tough guys do it  but that’s what’s so cool about PhuketFit  it’s all normal people who want to try new fitness training and their Thai boxing sessions have always got about 6-8 people and everyone’s laughing and having a really good time!,5
I read about detoxes first in magazines and the idea always peaked my curiosity  so when I was in Thailand last I had been spending some time in Phuket and I saw PhuketFit retreat when I was driving to the beach one day. When I got back I searched them and emailed them about doing a detox. I managed to just get in because there was one place still available and I feel so lucky now because it was really really good! It would have been terrible if I had missed my opportunity because it turned out to be even better than I expected and not only made me feel refreshed and rejuvenated but I also lost some weight which I’d been trying to get rid of for ages! Highly recommended!,5
I went to PhuketFit because after viewing the website and many others in Thailand it was obviously the best value for money  especially as the detox and all the classes and my food and everything was included for one price. After my first few days I knew I had made the right choice because I remember I was on the detox part of the program and I was feeling amazing  the sun was shining  a beautiful blue sky  I had just done a Yoga class and I was walking down to the beach  I got really into the program and loved it! I met so many great people too  everyone coming from different backgrounds  from different walks of life and all united together with similar goals for losing weight  getting fitter and healthy  detoxing and having a really good time. I loved it!,5
I was recommended to come for detoxing and that’s what I originally booked. Then after 3 days of my 10 day cleanse I extended my stay to add a 10 day fitness program after my detox. I only originally booked my bungalow for 10 nights  so when I extended my bungalow was booked and I had to book a hotel outside for the last 10 nights of my stay! So word of warning  they get booked up fast and it can be difficult to extend accommodation. I booked again before I left for this time next year!,5
The place is huge with different sections like their Yoga studio  restaurant servicing great food by the way  the fitness studio  full gym  all kinds of training areas  the resort with all the accommodation and even a full detox retreat as just part of their complex. Very impressed and liked how I moved around starting at the detox retreat for 5 days and then through the resort and I really used all their facilities throughout my stay. The variety and all the different things is what I liked best  I even did cooking classes!,5
Service  trainer standard  food and nutrition all top of the range  very impressed considering I expected it to maybe not be up to a US standard  but actually the trainers all came from abroad (England  New Zealand  Australia  etc) they’ve got top people training you.,5
I came from Singapore to try out the total fitness package that they run at PhuketFit resort. I did it for just 7 days but I now feel fitter  stronger and much more awake and alive.,5
I was impressed that this strong team of people from many different backgrounds. The head trainer was from New Zealand  one of the weight loss coaches France and another nice man was from England.he communication skills of the team were wonderful  the help was gracious and informative  the support and the fact that they are passionate about helping people was an added bonus that made this place well worth the visit. Very nice to see.,5
I like to look as sharp as possible for my work but when I’m busy my diet goes bad I lose all motivation and my body follows. When I finally decided to get up off my butt and do something about it I searched for weight loss retreats thinking I would do one in the states  but it worked out cheaper and actually much better to fly to Phuket and do a weight loss and fitness program there. So that’s why I did  I selected PhuketFit for it’s good reviews and affordable rates and booked myself in. Just got back recently and I feel like a new man  back in work  feeling good  looking sharp  it was really worth it!,5
I enjoyed my stay and will definitely come back  however do have some things so hopefully my next stay will be even better than my first. Sometimes classes started late  6 minutes late on one occasion. Too many staff in the restaurant  sometimes standing around. Maps of area needed in rooms. Overall very good  I’m a tough judge  but some things need tightening up. Definitely the best retreat I’ve found on the island.,3
Coming from the UK  Thailand was a big change for me  and I was so happy when I was met at the airport by their driver he was so nice and he helped me with my bags and before long I was arriving at the camp. I’ve done different boot camps and fitness retreats before  never in Thailand  but back home in England  but this was so much better. Almost all the sessions were open air and it was perfect temperature because it ws warm from the sun but it was also cool from the sea breeze coming in from the beach. I really trained my abs and core a lot and I can see a six pack now  so the results have been great.,5
The FOOD IS AMAZING! I loved the cooking classes too  I took so many notes and have been cooking all my favorite health meals myself now that I’m back! The exercise was challenging at times but I feel so good that I did it  I visibly lost weight in the ten days that I was there and I’m also beginning to do more exercise at home now  as well.,5
Researched many different options for my detox holiday and chose PhuketFit because I wanted to do more of an “active cleanse” instead of sitting around not doing much like I read in reviews about other retreats. PhuketFit is definitely active and definitely the best place for me!,5
I like to write  I like to travel  I like to try new things  so when I heard about PhuketFit and  more specifically  the detox retreat they have going on there  I was like “yeah  why now?”. I packed my bag and headed off into the unknown  I admit I felt a little apprehensive at first  but as soon as I arrived and got checked it  I knew this was the right place for me. Everything was laid out for me  everything made ready in advance  I felt like a bit of a prince to be honest  but it was time I had a little pampering. I spent 7 days on their detox retreat and ever since I’ve been on a natural high like I’ve never experienced before. If you haven’t detoxed before  this is something you should try.,5
Thailand being quite close to Australia is a place I like to travel to on occasion. Having been to Phuket before I had already heard about PhuketFit because they’re big on the island  a lot of guests go there and because they have a good experience they like to chat and rub in people’s faces how much weight they've lost  etc. Anyway  I got to thinking about it myself because I had a couple of kilos to lose  so I booked on to it and thought I’d give it go. I had never done a detox before and didn't think I ever would  but it was part of the program so I thought why not  it turns out I loved it and lost almost all the weight I had to lose in the first few days. I guess it agreed with me or something. After that I was doing all kinds of crazy fitness classes  did some boxing training  what do you know I even tried a Zumba class! Anyway it was a lot of fun and something I’m going to do with my wife in the near future I reckon.,5
I travel all the time in fact I’ve been to Phuket more than 4 times before finally going to Phuket Fit. I had actually been past the resort a number of times and popped my head in to see people doing all kinds of cool things from fitness classes  to detoxes and the food looked so amazing I went online and booked for my own 14 day weight loss retreat; I didn’t have much to lose  but I like to keep myself slim and in good shape. As imagined  the retreat was fantastic  starting with a 5-day-DETOX with the raw food  so delicious!  and then onto the weight loss training classes  health food eating  green smoothies  oil massages  herbal saunas  it was really amazing and I lost twelve pounds  yippee!,5
Me and a friend jumped on the Total Fitness Program for three weeks and loved it  really cool classes  I’m told the most variety in Thailand  we definitely enjoyed all the classes — and the trainers! You guys were great!!,5
The fitness classes I went to all had different ways of moving your body which was great because it exercised me in many different muscle groups and stretched me   I quickly improved my flexibility and many old aches and pains basically vanished. Sometimes when I sit dwn for work too long it can give me pain  but here with the Pilates classes  Yoga  TRX and all the different full-rotation movements and flexibility training I was doing  it really released the pain or something because it’s pretty much all gone. Highly recommended if you have pain  it worked great for me!,5
The weather was very different from back home with a lot of warm sunny days  a little bit of rain at night but not a lot for me. I was here detoxing for 10 days  it felt very good!,5
The staff is super nice and the nurse Aom very competent  nevertheless this place is not recommendable  for the detox programm they apply one single approach for everybody  regardless of one's background or goal - didn't work for me at all. Plus when I complained it took several weeks for them to get back to me with a decent answer actually I am still waiting for an answer now and it has been two months.,2
Quality camp for fitness in Thailand  the equipment at the gym section of the resort was all professional level and I was surprised to see that all the brands were from America  like Concept2 rowers  LifeFitness treadmills and LiveStrong Elliptical machines. The gym was great  but even more impressive were the fitness classes. I’m really into high intensity interval training which is what they do best  they also have TRX which I’m getting into now too  an obstacle course which is awesome fun and Muay Thai as well. The trainers are mostly from the states  UK and Australia  my favorite guy was from New Zealand  David was really great!,5
Heard about it for years  knew loads of people who had already been and loved it  wanted to go for a looooooong time  finally negotiated 3 weeks off  had kick-ass time on a combined Detox and Total Fitness program. This place rocks.,5
I came from Australia with some of my friends to PhuketFit retreat for a detox and weight loss holiday. It’s amazing! I actually didn’t know what I was expecting because it was one of my friends idea because she needed to lose quite a lot of weight and had been trying for many years but never really got anywhere. So we decided we’d all go together to support her and also so we could detox because after doing some research I had read that this retreat is the best place for detox in Thailand which got me excited because I’d always wanted to do a detox but never known where to start. When we arrived we were all professionally picked up and looked after  everyone felt great because we didn’t feel like trying to work out how to get a taxi and directions and all that kind of stuff  it was really nice they came and met us at the airport and whisked us away  such 5 star service. The retreat itself is really spectacular with so many different things to do and try  there were many cleanses and as part of the program everything was included for us which was super. By the end of our 21 days I have never felt better in my entire life. Uplifted  clear minded  open hearted  just amazing. My friend who was the reason we all came in the first place lost twelve and a half kilos which was shocking but absolutely incredible for her. What was even more great is before she left her weight loss coach planned out a full routine for her and nutrition plan for her to continue at home. She still has some weight to lose but it’s almost all gone and she’s so happy for it!,5
DEFINITELY the best place for detox in Thailand! I love how there’s so much to do  too. Like with some places I’ve detoxed before in Phuket and also in other places in the world you’re kinda just stuck there and it can be a little bit boring. But it’s so different at this retreat because you’ve got the oil massages  delicious raw food detox diet and nutrition throughout the day  really fun activities like Yoga  Pilates  variety of different fitness classes  there’s cooking lessons  there’s trips to the beach and surrounding area  there’s herbal sauna’s  there’s liver cleansing  there’s cleaning of the digestive system and tract  and loads more  there’s so many things to do and you simply feel incredible when you’re there. I came with a group from Australia  my friend did a 21 day weight loss retreat and really the weight she lost and the results she got were so inspirational  especially now she’s returned home. So many of our Australian friends are planning time off work to go now too. Thank you to everyone at PhuketFit! I’m sure we’ll be back for another detox at the end of this year  probably January.,5
Was here for a short while in March we came for the Cleanse program but also did a lot of yoga too. The raw food cleansing meals were delicious and we both really enjoyed all the pampering and the massages and saunas  we liked it.,5
I spent just 7 days at the retreat and in that time my body feels younger  stronger and much more physically fit. I had been looking for a fitness retreat in Thailand when I followed a recommendation to go here  I searched the web and saw that this retreat is very well respected with some fantastic results being achieved in very little time. I did a 7 day fitness program which also controlled my diet too which was optimised for my specific body type. There is a lot of science behind how they do things and that’s why I think I  and many others  are getting results so fast. Great place to go!,5
I went with a group of friends  we all came from Australia  to detox and also for me to get in shape too  I think that for people coming with a specific purpose in mind this place is great  like for example if you come for weight loss as your goal they then target everything toward that  or if you want to be in better physical shape  or increase level or fitness  or detox the body  all these things are what they’re setup to do. You get a coach who is assigned to you and they will change and custom fit everything to you. For me it worked great and my friends also got stunning results (one in particular).,5
The Total Fitness Program is incredible; TRX  Muay Thai  HIIT  Kettlercise  Pilates  I even did some Zumba! Really great variety of classes  personalized support and guidance  incredible diet  simply had a fantastic time.,5
I travelled far to join the PhuketFit program  normally I would try to find a place closer to where I lived but every time I’ve done that in the past it just didn’t work very well. I knew I had to get away from my normal environment to a place where all I was doing everyday was focusing on my goals. Also being surrounded by other who had the same goals as me. And it worked out just like I thought  being in the right place  with the right people makes all the difference. Now I feel like me again  the extra weight I’d accumulated over the years is gone and with my new diet I’m eating everyday I’m sure it’s gone for good!,5
I am a science graduate specializing in medical science and am always looking for new ways to keep my body fit and healthy. After researching for many days it quickly became apparent that PhuketFit was the right place for me based on the conversations I had with their health and wellness coaches  information on their website and reviews I read about them. Now  after having been through the entire program  I wanted to first say “thank you!” to everyone at PhuketFit for all your help and support and also say I was highly impressed by your nutritional and physical education  training and practices. Everything is so well researched and up to a very high standard.,5
Started with 7 day Detox Cleanse  then I did a 14 day Total Fitness program  my body is in the best shape I’ve ever seen it. Highly recommended.,5
It was a really fun experience for me with all kinds of new and interesting people. I lost weight  slimmed down  dramatically increased my energy + motivation for life  detoxified my body and turned to a new chapter in my life. Since returning I've felt so fresh and great and everyone’s noticed! Special thanks to Serge  David  Chef and everyone else who helped me feel this great!,5
I almost didn’t come because there was a mix up via email which  I understand  was actually my fault. Nevertheless I did attend and am so very grateful I did because I had what’s probably been the best 2-weeks of my life. It feels like a weight has been lifted from my chest  I feel lighter  like all the emotions  problems and everything I was going through has been released from my body and I feel free. I did the retreat for detox and some weight loss and it was truly a fantastic experience. So glad I came!!,4
I did a detox in Phuket here and after having detoxed in many places in Thailand I found PhuketFit to be the best for these reasons: 1- it’s much more than just a normal detox like I’ve done before in Samui and other places in Phuket  there’s many more cleanses included  a variety of fitness  yoga and pilates classes which I loved  the most delicious raw food I’ve ever eaten and just so much move included in the program. 2- the location is far better than any other retreat I’ve been to in and outside Thailand. 3- The atmosphere around the resort and retreat is upbeat and happy  people are all thrilled to be there and enjoying themselves. The staff are amazing and consultants and coaches are very professional.,5
Thank you to Liam  Serge  Mama  David  Ann  Jenna  Kate  Maiki!,5
My weight loss retreat at Phuket Fit is an experience I will remember for the rest of my life. The people. The staff. The coaches. The classes. The resort. and more importantly: the results. I had been trying to lose weight for many years but my progress had effectively stopped. I had plateaued and I felt like there was nothing I could do. But the weight loss coach at the retreat quickly diagnosed the problems and designed a plan which was personalized to me. When I started on this program everything began to change  slowly at first but after just a short while I could see dramatic changes in the mirror. I was shocked. I had tried and failed so many times but I realize now it’s all about being on that program which is custom fit to you specifically. Mind blowing!,5
Very good place for weight loss in Thailand and the detox at the beginning of the program was EXCELLENT. I traveled a long way (from the other side of the world) to do the program and it was worth all the time and money because I got fantastic results. The location also deems mentioning because not all of Phuket is actually that nice  some of the places north of the island are very built up  while in the south  where Phuket Fit is located  it is stunning. The beaches are some of the best I've ever seen  the surroundings have a natural organic feel to them  it's my paradise. I'll be back again for a fitness program to keep the fat I lost off for good. Thanks to the whole team!,5
Would have liked a few more night activities  but as far as the program  facilities  food  detox  trainers  staff and everything else about the retreat  really 10 out of 10.,4
It was a good time to take care of my body and my mind. It was the first time I detoxed and PhuketFit was definitely the right place for me.,5
Everyday I could see the difference in the bathroom mirror in my bungalow  day by day I was literally shedding fat before my eyes! I kept thinking to myself “I should have done this AGES AGO!” Why did I put myself through misery for so long when all I really needed to do was come to a retreat and have everything done for me. I’d literally spent years trying silly weight loss gimmicks and got nowhere. And then literally in 28 days I transformed my body at Phuket Fit when no one else could help me. I think the reason this works so well is because you get there and you don’t have to think or try to put things together yourself  you get a program coach who designed the entire program for you based on all your information and many more things that they track and measure which means the program is the fastest way for you specifically to lose weight  which is a massive shift from what I had been doing for years just trying to follow more generic plans or just trying to cut calories. And I also think being on Phuket island in such a fabulous location — and I just love Thailand! — especially Phuket  is huge because I was away from everybody and I felt I could finally be free and let the weight go that had been really killing me inside for years  shattering my confidence. Thank you to everyone who helped me shed my fat and get in shape  you know who you are — you’re the best!!,5
Okay so I’ve been to quite a few weight loss centers over the years  and before that I had tried a bunch of different methods and techniques  but nothing really worked for me. Any time I lost any weight  I put it straight back on again. I had literally pretty much given up on trying to lose weight and was at the point where I literally thought I would have belly fat forever. But then quite incidentally a friend of a friend was talking about this place in Thailand  and it really captured my imagination. Enough to go and do some research and see that this place looks legit. So literally just 6 weeks later I’m on a plane and arriving at Phuket airport to be met by a member of their team and shuttled to the retreat. From the start  the very first contact I ever had with them  to now has just been so professional  so results orientated and even if it sounds silly to say  so life changing. I’ve now lost almost all of the fat that plagued me for years and even more importantly I finally feel free and confident in my body. It wasn’t exactly cheap  but it was so so worth it.,4
At first I thought I’d go on a bit of a holiday in Phuket  I’ve been many times before and every time I go I try and be healthy  because hey it’s a healthy feeling place  you see people jogging and the food is pretty healthy. But I was searching around and I stumbled on different retreats and resorts for actual health holidays where they do everything for you and you just follow their plan and I immediately became excited to go! So after research I selected PhuketFit as in Google and around they seemed to be the oldest and most reputable and I signed up for the 4 day Detox program and then onto their 21 day Fitness program. Without going into too much details because I could write a LOT  this is the experience I had: first  this isn’t some loosely put together do-what-you-want kind of gig  this is a proper program which they literally custom fit to you specifically  I’m talking about the works - full out fitness evaluations  lung capacity testing  body fat percentage  water in the body  muscle amount  etc  etc - it’s really detailed. Then they create a program based on your information and are there to support you along the way  the help I got was great! At the end of my program I could see (and feel) the results of this meticulous planning and they delivered the results to me in a way that I could see all my progression. Anyway this is getting a bit long but yeah  I loved it!,5
Coming from my stressful daily live to this retreat was exactly what I needed. It was a really dramatic lifestyle change but with the beautiful environment  delicious food and really hospitable staff  I made a fluid transition and spent 14 lovely days there. I detoxed and then a joined a program with fitness training and health food dieting and really finally gave my body what it needed. I’d like to come here each year for a kind of detox  relaxation holiday before heading back to my manic lifestyle.,5
Very nice experience  very nice people  really well put together operation wise and everyone was so happy and losing weight for the first time. Thank you for helping me.,5
The retreat is just minutes from the beach  the location is really really good. The retreat looks very authentic from the outside  everything about it says Thailand but when you venture inside it’s modern  clean and advanced. The restaurant serves some of the nicest food I’ve ever eaten and in the gym and fitness studio I’ve had some of the best fitness classes I’ve ever attended. There are of course some things which aren’t great like they were doing building work and there were a few sights (like when you go up to the Yoga studio) which just looked messy. But as far as the program  training  diet and the the end results  this place can’t be beaten.,4
Good: highly certified coaches  delicious health food  advanced training facilities  beautiful location  excellent results. Bad: a bit of confusion sometimes at front desk  my single room was basic  I recommend a private bungalow or booking at the luxury resort next to Phuket Fit for accommodation.,4
Very nice stay  thank you  would like to come again  and I understand now about the mix up  it’s not a problem  everything turned out great actually; and I was very surprised when I came home and my family gasped as they witnessed my transformation. Thank you so very much for helping me!,5
Came for weight loss and lost 7.2kg in 16 days and kept it off for over a month and a half now. While there were a few things which weren’t perfect  if it’s weight loss you’re after  this is the place.,4
I like to keep in shape which is why I spent 2 weeks doing only that  just working out  eating a perfect diet  getting adequate sleep and rejuvenating my body with massages and herbal saunas. Their total fitness program turned out to be the perfect program for me and unexpectedly I learned a lot of new information about dieting for my specific body type  as well as tried new HIIT and really advanced trainings. There were a lot of people who were there for weight loss and many were not in great shape  but it was fine because there were beginner classes (which I skipped) and advanced classes which are the ones I went to. Everyone there was really nice and very friendly  a really great atmosphere around the camp.,5
Great food  friendly staff  highly professional fitness trainers and coaches  beautiful location albeit very quiet with few other things to do in the area apart from the beach; accommodation was pretty good  not amazing  fantastic results from my program. Highly recommended.,4
I’m a stay at home mom so I don’t get much of a chance to take a vacation  especially not one which is all for me! I travelled to PhuketFit in Thailand to enroll in the detox program for a full 14 days. The program itself and the location / retreat is awesome  really perfect blend of nature  organic foods  modern techniques  advanced cleansing  super-friendly coaches and team  really a great setup. I would have liked to be able to take more advantage of some of the more intense fitness training sessions that others guests were doing  but because I was detoxing it would have been too hard to keep up  I did all the Yoga and Pilates classes  some TRX sessions and even a bit of Muay Thai  but I really wanted to do the HIIT  but I guess next time maybe I will detox for the first 5 days and then switch to more of a fitness orientated program  many of the other guests I talked to were doing it that way  instead of just detoxing for the full 2 weeks. The detox was amazing though and I definitely needed it  by day 9 my entire body was fully cleaned out for the first time in I don’t know how long  really fascinating experience and very much enjoyed.,4
My time at PhuketFit was unfortunately cut short due to a family emergency  which was a real shame because I had spent 3 lovely weeks at the resort and I was looking forward to my last 7 days. Before I left I already booked a return holiday for another 14 days on the weight loss package because I could see so clearly the difference it was making for me. Almost everyday I would look in the mirror and clearly see the my belly was flatter and all over my body the fat was slowly melting away. Since arriving back home I’ve stuck to a similar program of healthy eating and some exercise but it really isn’t the same as going to a new environment and having everything done for you in one location. Plus  I found it made a dramatic difference to leave my home country and come somewhere completely new because I was away from all the negative influences which contributed to me putting the fat on in the first place! So I highly recommend this resort for losing weight and by listening to the advice and continuing when you return home  I think I can keep the fat off for life!,5
Upon arriving at the retreat I immediately noticed that it was huge  with different departments all specialized to a different part of the program. I was pleasantly led through a process which involved pin pointing my specific starting point so the program could then be adapted and custom fit to me perfectly. This was really impressive because at first I had some worries that because I was out of shape I wouldn’t be able to take advantage of everything that the program had to offer. But this really wasn’t the case. In fact the way it was done completely optimized my experience so I could do everything and make use of it all  in a way that helped me get the fastest weight loss results I could for my specific body type  age  fitness level  and many more factors that were all taken into account. The best part of the journey for me was the Detox in the beginning of my program because within the first 5 days  not only did I lose a lot of weight  I finally got back to feeling like the real me again. For years I’ve let things get on top of me and for years this has caused me strong emotional pain. I felt like life wasn’t worth it all at times and I would often feel depressed. Yet after just a couple of day on the detoxification process I began to feel alive again  I could see new opportunities in my life  I got back my love for life and everybody in it and I’ve felt that same way every day since. It’s had an amazing effect on me and it’s pushed me to try new things and go for what I really want in life again  instead of just waiting and not really do much of anything at all. Others I spoke to had similar experiences to me  while some didn’t have quite as profound experiences  all were happy  upbeat and loving their time on the retreat. For me it’s changed how I think  how I feel  how I act and how I am in my daily life  absolutely priceless.,5
Coming here was the best thing I’ve done in years and it was so unexpected because my boyfriend booked as a surprise and didn’t tell me the details until I suddenly found myself in a health resort in Thailand! I like to keep healthy and do a little exercise but it’s no secret that I had lost some of my shape over the years  my boyfriend too  so while I was definitely surprised I was also completely delighted by his choice and we both dived in and had a really great time. We were there for just 3 weeks and at the end I really wanted to continue for another week and complete a 28 day course  but we had to be getting back so when I got home I completely continued doing the healthy eating and exercise and still now I’m still doing a lighter version of the course. Really unexpected and really really good!,5
Originally I was going to do this in the UK  but it worked out cheaper and much better to hop on a plane and do it in Thailand because this type of thing is really expensive in western countries. I was very much impressed by the level of professionalism among the staff and team  as well as the facility itself  which was outstanding  one thing I would like to note is while the food was very good  the menu when I was there was very confusing and difficult to use. I was told there would be a new menu which did finally appear  on my last day there. Still  just a small thing but one I wanted noted  overall I highly recommend traveling to Thailand for a health holiday as opposed to paying more and doing it in your home country.,4
TRX  HIIT  Kettlercise  Pilates  Muay Thai  Yoga  Boot Camp  CrossFit …even Zumba  I did it all at PhuketFit! Keep it up guys and special thanks to Liam and David!,5
Coming here with my girlfriend turned out to be one of the funnest things we’ve ever done together. I wasn’t sure if this was the anniversary she was looking for  but we had both previously agreed to lose ten pounds and get in healthy shape — and neither of us had taken any steps to do that. So I plotted by myself hehe to get us to a place where we’d feel motivated and inspired to achieve this goal  while also having a fun and relaxing holiday in Phuket (which we both love by the way!). Okay so first day and we’re looking at each other like okay-hope-we-know-what-we’re-getting-ourselves-in-to because this place is detailed with specific programs designed and customised to each specific person with their specific body type  specific wants and needs and everything else. It was a little bit of a surprise but we both just jumped in and our motivation levels were immediately ramped up high! By the second day all we could think about was the program and making the most out of this truly amazing experience of finally having everything perfectly setup to achieve our goals. We had the help  the support  the diet  the training  the environment  all that we ever needed — and did I mention that EVERYTHING is personalised to you  so it’s not like you just get put on some generic program  it was different person to person based on a number of different things and using some pretty advanced metrics and calculations. Really blew us away and by the last day  we were looking at each other like we were seeing each other for the first time  we’re in so much better shape. It also brought us closer together than ever before and in such a romantic location  it was just what we both needed. Thank you!,5
My girlfriend  Katey  and I stayed here for just over 3 weeks for a detox holiday in Phuket. We have done detoxes in other places in Thailand like in Chiang Mai and also Hua Hin  and this time we wanted to try something a little difference. You see the major difference between the detox provided at PhuketFit and others that we have seen and tried  is that there is so much more to it. In every other place we know of  a detox is very simple and pretty much involves doing some cleanses and then sitting around for most of the day  sure there may be a sauna for half an hour and a massage  a bit of Yoga maybe  but generally not much to do. While at PhuketFit there’s a series of different cleanses like liver cleansing  follower by cleansing the gut and colon  and many more  combined with Yoga classes  Pilates classes  other fun fitness classes  a fully equipped fitness gym  delicious raw food if you choose a raw cleanse  herbal sauna  shuttle to all the local beaches  oil massages  therapy sessions  swimming pool  personal coaching  and on and on. It’s a full program start to finish and left us both feeling like we’d completely renewed both our minds and bodies. If you want to detox in Thailand  try this place!,5
Because I work freelance in IT I spend a little too much time sitting down then is good for me. That’s why I try to visit this retreat for at least two weeks each year for a complete rejuvenation process involving detoxification  cleansing  healthy eating  fitness classes  Yoga and a nice big helping of rest and relaxation.,5
Had a really great time on the weight loss program here and have been receiving LOADS of compliments from all my family and friends since I’ve returned home. My body is in much better shape  everyone’s saying I look amazing and I definitely feel it  too!,5
Did a fitness retreat over a 28 day period and very pleased with the results. Completely shed the fat off my stomach and added some lean muscle tone too  everyone’s saying I’m looking great! Most of all I feel completely fresh now  and since I’ve been back I’ve been really focused on my work and in the zone. Great experience  will return for at least 2 weeks next year.,5
Really enjoyed my time and wanted say a big thank you to all the team at PhuketFit  you really made my holiday!,5
Stayed here for a week with a friend to do a full fitness overhaul and take some time to think about what we want to do with our future and the rest of our lives. They just employed a new trainer called David from NZ who ran some really awesome fitness sessions doing cutting edge stuff I haven’t even seen before  and I like to think I know about this stuff. After researching these methods I was really impressed by the spin of HIIT  TRX combined with more traditional training for stretching like Pilates and Yoga. The facility is modern inside  traditional Thai outside  with high end machines  and equipment  really forgot I was in Thailand when I saw all the fitness trainers were from western countries and all highly educated and trained in their field. Thought we’d go for some simple fitness trained  shocked by the level of professionalism and results we got from our programs.,5
While I wouldn’t say the retreat is perfect  it is very good at helping people lose weight in a surprisingly short period of time. For example  a woman I met had spent 28 days on the weight loss program at Phuket Fit and lost a massive 18 kilo’s  she had a lot to lose of course and still had a lot more to go  but it was amazing and very motivational to see and hear these successes first hand. Another person I met  Paul  a 42 year old accountant from the UK  lost 5 kilo’s inside of one week and I literally witnessed the whole thing  what shocked me about this case is that he didn’t even have much weight to lose  just a beer belly I guess  and by the end I would describe him as being in very good shape. I did the 14 day program myself and lost 6 kilo’s  I think I could have lost more had I really stuck to the program all the way through  but it was my first time in Thailand and I went off a bit here and there  it was holiday for me after all and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only things that weren’t great was that when I first checked in the first two nights a dog barked outside until late and because I was jet lagged  etc  it was very annoying. However  after that the dog was no where to be found and I slept like a baby for my remaining time there. Another thing was they were completing a building job at the back of the retreat  it was the final stages so it wasn’t noisy or anything  but it was a bit of a building site back there and  I know  can’t be helped but maybe some kind of temporary divider so it would be completely out of site for guests  but that’s all can really say for the negative  and the results everyone was getting from their programs more than made up for the minor issues. Definitely worth going and will certainly be back again soon.,4
PhuketFit has a special place in my heart because my boyfriend and I have now spent three really special health holidays together here  you’re team have got it right  keep it up and we’ll be back again and again and again  special thank you to Liam!,5
Travelled all the way from France to enrol in their weight loss management program because this retreat came highly recommended by a good friend  and colleague  of mine. Very professional retreat and I must say surprised by the continual help and support I received throughout my entire time there. In fact  even now I have completed my program and very pleased by the results  I am still receiving information to help me continue on my new found path in my everyday life. Recommended.,5
What I loved the most was the attention to detail  my entire program was planned out and personalized to me  including exactly what training to do to get the best results  my specific diet and everything else in between. Really very impressive.,5
Just got back  had a really great time  loved the training  adored the food  and will definitely be back again soon!,5
Pros: loads of support  awesome facility  delicious food  friendly staff and motivational trainers. Cons: our bungalow was rather basic  would have liked the shuttle bus to have gone to more places  more night activities needed. Overall: we really loved our stay and got great results from our programs.,4
I had a fabulous time and wanted to share a little of my experience. I loved the food  it was simply delicious  all kinds of healthy ingredients  like mung beans  chai seeds  fresh salmon  cooked with healthy oils and prepared with organic seasonings. My coach was amazing; he helped me plan my exercise program and kept track of all my data  like body fat percentage  water retention and even how much muscle to fat ratio I had. The whole experience was really impressive. Excellent Services. Keep it up.,5
This has been my third time at PhuketFit and again I've really enjoyed it. Some of the trainers have changed since last time which was fun for me because the style of classes were different from my last visit. The detox was great as always and I really liked the level of detail I got from the program results.,4
I have recently returned for a planned 3 week wellness retreat at Phuketfit 10 days early. This has been the most disappointing  unprofessional and misleading experience. To list: BAIT AND SWITCH! When I booked  I was told the only room available was the bungalow. When I arrived I was put into the large basic room and CHARGED for the bungalow NO REFUND GIVEN. I was told by Maiki that the bungalow was the same as the large room and were the same price. However  I saw the bungalow. It had a living room  kitchen and a separate bedroom and bath. When I questioned why I was diverted to the large room  I was told the bungalow had been reserved for one year and the guest was staying three months. If this was true  why was I told that it was the only option for my accommodation? Secondly  I was totally unprepared for the three pages of rules left in my room. No toilet paper allowed!?! Please  ridiculous. The way it was put  was insulting and patronizing. Third  the accommodations were very primitive. Fourth  no noise after 9:30 pm  yet a large dog was allowed to bark until 1:00 AM  so much for sleep. Fifth  the TRX instructor had quit  and Kris was put in his/her place. Everyone was told about his ebook  however  Kris gave NO INSTRUCTIONS as to proper form and breathing to two guests that had never used the TRX. In fact  he actually told one woman she had perfect form as she was hinged at the waist!!! Someone will get hurt in this class. Website says Gym/Pro Shop on site - this was a joke. Nothing in the shop except Phuket Fit shorts and t-shirts. No yoga clothes  mats.nothing. On a positive note.the detox center was wonderful! Om is very knowledgeable and involved with your guests. Serge gave me insight into what was going on with my system and started me on a program to lose weight. Another concern was the guest who didn't feel well and retreated to his room and was not seen for four days. Staff was notified and refused to look into it. Only when a group threatened to call a doctor and the police did they investigate. He was found to be in the room  lethargic  yellow eyes and yellow skin. Om's words not mine. After further investigation  it was discovered he was drinking in the room. I left before anything was resolved. The classes for me were limited. I did discover and learn from Nong and Sophia. The rest of the classes I could not take due to my knee problems. I was told by reception NOT to walk to the nearest beach as it was dangerous. Rules stated that our doors should be locked at all times - even when we were in our rooms. Safety is a concern here. I would not recommend this facility to anyone. The final insult. I sent via wire transfer $4000 Thai Bhat to their bank for my deposit. I paid ALL fees while there. I was returned only only $3564 Thai Bhat. Apparently I had to absorb not only my own banking fees THEIR banking fees as well. UNACCEPTABLE. Complete unprofessionalism. Lack of communication and a LOT of photoshop used in their website pictures. (pool is TINY) A lot of critical information is left out of their website descriptions of the property which would have affected my decision to go there. DECEPTIVE.,1
We make our way to do training here for fitness and to improve our health. We were very impressed with the trainers and the different fitness classes that were part of the package. Thank you to Justin especially and San too!,4
We booked into PhuketFit over the holidays season because we'd heard so many great things from a friend of mine and wanted to check it out. Turned out to be crazy good and definitely going back for longer next time.,5
The fitness program is really really good. We were both very impressed. Our program also started with a 5 day detox which I wasn't really looking forward to  but actually turned out to be one of the highlights. They have bungalows at their resort too but we stayed in the luxury hotel next-door called Navatara. It was a special holiday for us and we wanted 5*. We're going to be back in Phuket again soon and we are strongly considering enrolling in another program!,5
This was an amazing holiday for me! I did the raw food detox for 7 days and was amazed by how I felt by the end. It's such a cleansing experience. I highly recommend it.,4
Overall a really great time! I would have liked to been there when they had the new meal plan because that looked delicious. But from the time I was there to the end I really enjoyed myself and have lost a lot of weight too. I was really impressed by the cleanse  it was a real detoxification and the fitness training and trainers were awesome. Definitely go back to Phuketfit.,4
I come here for detox in Phuket before. I'm from Brazil and I really enjoy going to Thailand to explore and relax. PhuketFit was definitely one of the best parts for me because just relaxing with the detox and doing yoga class and many fitness class was very nice.,5
I came here from the States and had a really great time. The Detox at Phuket Fit was the best one I've been to in Thailand and I have been to many detox retreats in Phuket and all over Thailand. After completing the detox I started a fitness program and did TRX classes which I have done before in America. The people were all really friendly and it's great to have other people with you when on this style of camp. One down point was that when I went the main yoga teacher was away and there was a replacement who I'm told isn't as good. But it's ok because I have something to look forward to next time.,4

Translation:Amazing holistic wellness retreat in the south of Phuket. The instructors  staff and owners are incredibly welcoming and make you feel as part of the family. The services and activities are varied and the instructors super passionate and knowledgeable. Will be back for sure!!,5

I went to attend a course at Phuket Cleanse during the New Year period. I was very impressed. The atmosphere was relaxing  vibrant  and the activities were diverse. It is a holistic health center that truly focuses on detox. Owner Stanton has a wealth of knowledge in health care. He integrates everything.

I have heard great things about Phuket Cleanse but I admit I was initially sceptical of the glowing reviews. | I have to eat my words as the 5 days I spent in PC were absolutely transformative. | The food is insanely delicious and healthy. You can ask for a customised smoothie anytime to maintain your gains. | The activities are thoughtfully scheduled so you can have a mix of easy and hard workouts  as well as classes to unlock your mind's potential. | Your laundry gets done daily and returned to you by the late afternoon. | The staff are all extremely friendly and accommodating. I enjoyed our conversations with them from the deeply personal to the offbeat. | My tip to people sitting on the fence about PC? Go in with an open mind and you will be pleasantly surprised.,5
This place is magical  from Mel with her mystical healing powers  to the team in the kitchen who produce phenomenal delights daily  you have an endless array of activities and choices to heal. I have been to PC 3 times already and will keep going back for more magic  more group training  more Thai hospitality  and the camaraderie that is the friendships for life you make with the other guests from around the world. Thank you Mel and Stanton for creating heaven on earth.,5
Thank you so much to the whole Phuket cleanse team!What a fabulous community you have built around a lovely facility in Phuket. We really enjoyed all the activities  with so many options for interesting and varied physical  spiritual  and emotional activity. All of your team of instructors and staff were amazing and knowledgeable but most of all we were made to feel very welcome and included in the community. We also enjoyed all the other guests who were of like mind and are also integral to that community at PC.The food of course is worth special mention  absolutely first class  delicious  healthy  and clean food. We hope to recreate that as best we can in Scotland.We are spending the weekend trying to see how we can best incorporate some of the activity and classes into our normal busy lives and hope to reach out to others in Scotland that can help with that too.A much needed cleanse.Thank you again  keep up the good work and very much hope to see you next year!Murray,5
If there were more than 5 stars I'd give them freely. This place is a true gem - so good for one's soul  body and mind. The owners  the team  the location come together to create a unique and incredibly comfortable experience. Cannot wait to plan my next stay. Thank you Phuket Cleanse,5

I was in Phuket Cleanse for 3 weeks and was surprised with the uniqueness of this place. Haven't found any retreats in Thailand which have a bit of everything and focus on one's mental and physical wellbeing. They have classes ranging from fitness to breathwork to skincare - really something for everyone. The owners  Mel and Stanton have put their heart and souls into the place and take feedback on board! The cleanse is amazing but needs to do some reorganization with management to run things more smoothly and professionally. Staying for 3 weeks it can get lonely with the different waves of people coming in and leaving but I managed to get a lot of support from the staff and especially Megan Monk  who was my wellness and lifestyle coach. She really helped me find my place in PC (Phuket Cleanse) and in life. I'm super grateful for my time there and the coaching I received to help continue my healing and my journey of life! I would recommend this retreat to anyone looking for a holistic approach to well-being (both mental and physical) and for anyone who needs a little push and a friend in life  to reach out to Megan Monk :),3
"Translation:""It’s difficult to find the words to describe the incredible experience I had at Phuket Cleanse.

I don’t have enough superlatives for my review. Firstly I went because I needed a break and reset and couldn’t have found a happier  safer place full of the most authentic and kind group of people both as guests and employees. |It’s a truly unique place. It may not be the flashiest of accommodation  and if you want that then go to a modern Stay Well. But this place had so so much heart which is way more important. |The food is divine and so healthy  and the communal meals are a lovely touch as really brought you all together. Also as someone who liked quiet time  if I wanted to eat quietly on own  there was no issue at all. Everyone was made to feel comfortable. |The classes and schedules were fantastic and catered for everyone both emotionally and physically. Location is great for beaches and there are daily beach visit options as well as the more vigorous choices. |I was surrounded by people who were returning guests  some even 5 times so that speaks volumes. |Stanton  Mel  Adam  Alecia  Tara  Tor and Dariush are just the best humans ever and thank you all for your wonderful and true kindness. Xxx ps. So yes you should choose this place!,5
Phuket Cleanse feels like home but better. This home allows you to take care of your body and mind  while everything else is taken care of. The rooms are comfortable  the food is scrumptious and the surroundings are dreamy. No better place to take care of yourself. No better owners to be welcomed by. Simply no better place for a rejuvenating holiday.,5

The most magical  grounding  and fulfilling place on earth I have been to Phuket cleanse twice  first time I went on my own after leaving a job and just needed a reset. It was the perfect experience for me as I was surrounded by like minded solo travellers who wanted to reconnect with themselves by healing their mind body and soul. I just came back from my second trip to Phuket Cleanse and this time  I went with 4 of my best girlfriends for my bachelorette party 🥳 Now before you roll your eyes  it was the perfect experience I didn’t know I needed. From sun up to sun down we filled our day with all inclusive activities like sunrise hike  the most magical hot yoga  Muay Thai  ice bath  infrared sauna  HIIT class  breath work and meditation  daily massages  and the most delicious vegetarian / pescatarian dishes that taste like they were crafted with the utmost care. We had the most fun dancing to a curated silent disco and took shots of coconut water and kombucha. But most importantly we felt WELL. The facilities and grounds are simultaneously lush and luxe but very reasonably priced. But the best part is the people. From the staff to the other guests  everyone at Phuket cleanse went above and beyond to ensure we had the best possible experience. Go to Phuket cleanse if you want to feel truly well and cared for. It’s the reset you didn’t know you needed.,5
This place is amazing. Upon my arrival  I had a very helpful discussion about my intentions. Together  we created a customized program from the numerous available options. I came here for weight loss and mental clarity. Not only did I achieve my goals  but I also learned a new way of eating and breathwork to manage my stress. I was also supported by new friends with different objectives. I pushed myself with ice baths and beach walks  and indulged in a therapeutic Thai massage in my room. Every one of my needs and desires was taken care of. I wanted to extend my stay  but the place is fully booked. With the food preparation and menus I learned here  I will continue my program until my next visit. I cannot thank Stanton and his hardworking team enough!,5
A very rare health center that combines physical  mental  and spiritual cultivation  with all-day fitness classes  meditation  and various inspiring workshops. My husband and I both love it there  he almost loses one kilogram a day.The daily meals are also very delicious  mostly vegetarian  with some seafood and eggs  and the professional chefs can help you make special dishes almost anytime.The staff are all very friendly  and you can also meet friends from all over the world.An excellent travel experience  we will definitely come back.,5
Phuket Cleanse is the most amazing retreat I’ve ever been to. I discovered new parts of myself  let go of things I’ve been holding onto for years  and found a new sense of contentment and self-love. It’s all about the mind work  which they offer in abundance. Greg’s breathwork felt like such a deep release  and I definitely gained a better understanding of myself/certain habits. He really reads people and knows that each person needs.Best food I’ve ever had in a retreat  super cool people  Stanton is a legend and I just love the place SO much!!! I know I’m not alone thinking this  everyone I meet and talk to there is also loving it  and feeling so great about themselves. Can’t wait to come back already. Thank you SO much PC for changing my life in all the best ways ❤️,5
I have come here 4 times and hopefully more often! I love the community  the times  the food  the education  and the entertainment!! At Phuket Cleanse  there is something for everyone and no day is the same. Everyone can customize their schedule according to their needs and thus experience each day in a new way. The food is exceptional - diverse  healthy  and flavorful. There is competition and energy that unites people with similar mindsets - I have met a lot of good people here. We have created friendships  laughed  cried  and experienced unforgettable moments. Love Phuket Cleanse - Thank you for everything x,
Definitely recommended for wellness retreat (& fat loss program). Daily physical and emotional activities available  lodging includes laundry service and food! Food were great & is the highlight of this trip (juice cleanse available on weekend). Airport transfer can be arranged at THB 1k. Instructors and hosts were great and friendly  will be back whenever I needed a place to recharge!,5
This Wellness Retreat was unbelievable in every way! The staff  the food  the classes. All of it blew me away! If you need a total body reset or if you just need to get away and relax this is your place! Beyond amazing!,5
Phuket Cleanse was recommended to me by friends who have been several times and I was keen to spend Christmas there to end my year. I stayed for 8 nights and really felt relaxed by the end of my second day! I wish I had booked for longer and am planning a 2 week stay at the end of the year! There are so many sessions to participate in with lots of choices. The PC team are great with so much experience and very easy to chat to and get advice from. It was lovely to meet so many people (both guests and the PC team) from Asia  Europe  Africa and the Americas each with their own story. If you’re looking for a physical  emotional or mental reset at a wonderful location with great activities  great food and great company try Phuket Cleanse! I highly recommend it.,5
Best retreat ever,5
PC is the ultimate cleansing trip everyone needs! Not even sure where to begin  the experience felt like a magical and miraculous journey. It was so fun  delicious  invigorating  and healing! Our group bonded so well with each other  can't wait to come back already! Thank you for existing <3,5
I wanted to give a heartfelt thank you to you all for helping me during my time at PC. I came out of the retreat with a lot of self reinforcements  epiphanies and realisation/growth. For me  it was quite nerve wrecking to travel alone  but honestly with all of you being there  it made it such a comforting journey. It felt like a home away from home. The program is agenda packed and I was sure to be occupied with a lot of sessions that I wanted to attend  such a breathe work  ice baths  Muay Thai etc. Also  the concierge service is second to none! I’ll be back at some point! Thank you so much all!,5
To put simply: The best stay I’ve had in a long time and everything we could have wanted from a health retreat. We’ve just finished a 7-night stay in June ‘23 and I’d absolutely recommend PC to anyone. The instructors were so knowledgeable  the rooms were fantastic  the food was incredible and the programme of exercise classes and activities were very well put together. Mel  Stanton and the entire team have created a fantastic experience and a great place to achieve any health goal you may have - We’re absolutely coming back again!,5
100% recommended! I visited Phuket Cleanse for 5 days in June 2023 (not enough time!)  and it was life changing. There was a variety of classes and activities to participate in daily (yoga  muay thai  cooking  breathwork  hikes  etc)  and they were all hosted by industry leaders. I felt stronger and more energized after every class. The staff were so welcoming  accommodating and friendly. Stanton and Mel are clearly so passionate about what they do  and this translates into the whole experience. The food was incredible  delicious and healthy (how?!). They even have options for juice cleanses  which I opted into for one day (it was equally delicious and healthy). I especially loved the community vibe of coming together and eating with all the guests; as a result  I met so many interesting people from all walks of life. There's also a spa house onsite where there are compression pants to stimulate circulation in your legs  a red-light therapy room  and a mineral bath. I can't forget to mention having free massages in the comfort of my own room was something I benefited from as well! The retreat is well-located  close to a little Phuket town full of restaurants  cafes  shops  bars and spas. Phuket Old Town is just a 25-minute uber ride away (inexpensive)  and definitely worth a visit! I'm so happy I got to work on my fitness and wellbeing  at times pushing myself out of my comfort zone  and Phuket Cleanse was the perfect place to do it. I'll definitely be back again. HIGHLY recommended!,5

Translation:My wife and I visited Phuket Cleanse and will return as soon as we can. In fact 3 of the other guests who attended at the same time as us were there on their 2nd and 3rd visits. That is a testament to Mel and Stanton (the owners) who are incredibly authentic and invested in making your experience exactly what you need it to be. The rest of the staff are also remarkably talented  particularly the coaches and breathwork trainers. The meditation classes were extremely enlightening and enjoyable. I loved the paint bar  quantum jumping  intention setting  ice baths  kundalini meditation  reiki and hot yoga. The Big Buddha hikes were outstanding  it was great to push yourself for a common goal with the other guests. We made fast friends through the communal atmosphere and supportive environment. I learned so much about myself and I gained life-changing tools that I have applied back here at home. The value you receive at Phuket Cleanse is immeasurable! The food and accommodation + various scheduled activities and facilities like the infrared sauna  magnesium float tank  massages  compression recovery aids and steam rooms are genuinely so generous. It is really so cheap for what is on offer. Can’t wait to return at our earliest chance. Loved every moment  what an abundantly magical place! Sending love  gratitude and appreciation to all the staff xoxox Carly and Tresne,5
I love Phuket Cleanse. | I feel so relaxed and comfortable. After a day at PC  I feel like I've been there for over a month. | Where to start? | The atmosphere is extraordinary (good vibes). Stanton  Mel  and Tamara welcome you with all their kindness and empathy. I am also impressed by the human qualities and the profile of the clients. | The daily activities are of great quality. From morning walks (6 am)  yoga  more or less intense sports activities to meditation workshops - you will feel grown in a relaxed environment and without pressure. | Add to all this the few massages included in your stay. | You will come back home  refreshed  with a smile on your face  ready to share your good energy with your loved ones. Thank you Mel  Stanton  Tamara  and Jenny for creating such a place. ||,5
I often travel around the world  but this time is a life-changing and very memorable experience. || Going to Phuket Cleanse was a birthday gift to myself. Everything was so perfect! || Mel and Stanton are always so warm and thoughtful. On the first day at the cleanse  I had a profound one-on-one conversation with Mel. She recommended that I learn Muay Thai and yoga  which quickly helped my shy personality integrate into communal living. There is laundry service every day  massages three times a week  highly recommended Sunny! Every week  you will have a comprehensive schedule where you can participate in a variety of activities according to your own situation  such as yoga  Muay Thai  hiking  painting  ice bathing  meditation  and more. The breakfast  lunch  and dinner are nutritious and delicious! Many guests are repeat customers  coming back many times. I am very grateful to everyone for giving me such an unforgettable journey! I will strive to come back every year.,5
Phuket Cleanse: where to start? I am still trying to elaborate on the perfection that was this experience. It changed my life for the better in so many ways. I found a strength within me that had been forgotten for years. ||From the warm reception that makes you feel like part of a big family  the place as a whole (rooms  facilities)  and a program truly designed for you to reset from the daily hustle and bustle. And the best part: you can choose how much you want to dedicate yourself and take the classes. There is no pressure at all.||The food deserves a chapter of its own: undoubtedly  the healthiest food I have ever had in my life. During the week  I opted for a predominantly plant-based diet and on the weekend I did the juice and soup detox protocol. Words cannot explain how much the detox made me feel lighter  less bloated  cleared my brain fog  and gave me a lot of energy. I would wake up at 5 in the morning ready for hikes! This had never happened before in my 35 years of life. ||Every detail conveys the care and dedication of the wonderful team: Mel  Stanton  Michael  Darius  Aoife  Jenny  Adam  Emily  Julia  and many other amazing people who masterfully lead the operation  in addition to the other guests. I can say that I made friends for a lifetime!||My intention was to address years of burnout from the corporate world and the challenges of my immigration process from Brazil to Canada. Only those who live far from their family  far from their culture  know what it's like. I came out of this experience with the certainty of my inner strength and knowing that I now have a refuge to return to whenever I need. ||Thank you very much  Phuket Cleanse  for everything!,5
Nice retreat with fully packed schedule of fun & beneficial activities for mind & body. Super hospitable staff and amazing food!! Strong sense of community with fellow guests,5
Enjoyed the same day laundry service & in room massages. Tasty & nutritious dishes  the detox ice cream such a treat. Lost 3kg  gained new friends  ice bath  aerial yoga & soundscape my highlights. Friendly welcoming team of professionals caring & supporting and lots of fun.,5
We spent 4 nights in this exceptional place in Phuket. The welcome and staff were very friendly  under the leadership of the dynamic American owner Stanton. The rooms are well-equipped  the daily free laundry service is very pleasant  and the meals are often delicious  vegetarian and low in carbohydrates. The center offers many sports and relaxation activities. The use of a WhatsApp group to disseminate daily information may seem practical for some  but we preferred to interrupt it for the sake of serenity. The presence of professional dietary advice or follow-up would have been useful to us. Having to leave the center earlier for personal reasons  Stanton offered us to come back for the 3 lost nights free of charge  and the few minor technical problems were taken seriously and fixed.,4
Happiness in its purest form is Phuket Cleanse.To sum up the Phuket Cleanse team in one word: amazing. From the moment you arrive until you leave  you are surrounded by people who smile  are there to support you  listen to you  and help you in any way they can.The activities and workshops. There is so much to do. From Muay Thai (I absolutely love those sessions)  to early morning hikes at 6 am  hot yoga  swimming  breathing classes  and strength sessions. There is something for everyone. The flexibility allows you to choose how much you want to do  which is great for those who prefer to sit back and relax.The food. I never thought I would survive on a vegan diet (now there are fish options). But the food is fresh  colorful with all the vegetables  and tasty! Every meal is unique  well selected  and an absolute delight.I have been visiting since 2017  and it is definitely a place I will continue to return to. If you are looking to feel better  happier  more at peace  and in tune with yourself  book your spot. You won't regret it.Stanton and Melanie  thank you. I really don't smile as much as when I am at Phuket Cleanse. I feel alive  energetic  and motivated when I am there and I really can't thank you enough for being genuine  attentive  and fun. To Thor  Tamara  Dani  Zora  Jenny  Mukesh  and EVERYONE else who make PC what it is  a million thanks!,5

A magical place. The perfect place for everyone who wants to find themselves and achieve their mental and physical goals. I arrived with no expectations  I only had my expectations of myself. Break out of my head and find my heart. Also get back in shape. The tools are made available to you through various exercises  be it sports such as yoga  muay thai  endurance and strength or mental exercises such as breathwork  meditation  hypnosis. Thanks for the wonderful frames set by a sensational team - thanks to Stanton  Melanie  Melanie and Michel  Ksenia  Tamara  Adam  Magda  Zora  Oleg  Mirka  Meow  Tor  Michael  the cleaners  the cooks  the driver - sorry if I forgot someone  thanks to everyone that I was able to find myself through you and slowed down. I will come again next year. I am really looking forward to meeting you. Thanks for the positive outburst from myself. Last but not least  the surroundings  the rooms  the location and the food were a 10 out of 10. Thanks!,5
This place is a breath of fresh air  if you’re considering coming here then JUST DO IT. The food is amazing  classes are incredible  the people are so friendly & overall this made my trip to Thailand super special. I am grateful I got to visit this gem tucked away in Phuket  enjoy!! I’ll be back soon,5
PhuketCleanse has been my retreat for years to recharge my batteries. Stanton and Melanie offer the perfect mix of wellness  clean food  coaching  sports  and excursions for me. The on-site team is as diverse as the guests  which in turn makes it so familiar and unique. There is something for everyone  whether you enjoy being in a group or simply want to be by yourself. Even for late risers who didn't make it to the fantastic Buddha Hikes at sunrise  the creative team in the kitchen conjures up a late breakfast. No pressure  just relaxed and with a smile - or a joke from Stanton.Upon returning home  I am always asked how refreshed I look #PhuketCleanseGlow ;) Ben and I have already booked our flight for our next trip in October and are looking forward to it. Thanks to the entire PhuketCleanse team for our unforgettable first vacation together after the Corona lockdowns! Natalie & Ben,
No place better to stay than here,5
Where to start with the fantastic Phuket Cleanse.! From the personalized WhatsApp group with key members of staff before you arrive and during your trip (which allows you to book things/ask questions/get help when you lock yourself out of your room  etc.) through to the packed daily schedule and amazing food for every single meal  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.I was very nervous about coming  but every single member of staff took the time to make me feel welcome  get to know me  and understand my goals  allowing me to make the most of my week's stay. I went all in and tried everything - from activities I had done before (such as long hikes and strength and conditioning classes) through to things I never knew existed  from breathwork to ice baths. There is also Muay Thai boxing (both group and one-on-one sessions included)  which I hadn't tried before but just couldn't get enough of.What's clear is that Stanton and Mel are passionate about wellness and also ensuring a varied itinerary that brings you the best and latest thinking about all aspects of wellness. For maximum impact  they fill Phuket Cleanse with amazing and passionate instructors and staff who bring the full experience to life and have allowed me to walk away with life skills that will support me and ensure I continue to grow even when I am back at home.I can't write a review without mentioning the daily laundry and the included massages - these really take the place to another level! My personal favorite aspect was also that you could walk into the kitchen and request smoothies or a protein shake or even a fresh coconut - what a treat. There are also cooking lessons included.,5
Amazing place everWas there 3 years agoHad lovely time :),5
5 stars are not enough as I would rate this as trillion stars. So grateful to have the opportunity to visit Phuket Cleanse that is a wellness disneyland  as my first solo trip! Melanie and Stanton are lovely hosts and the remaining staff is also super nice.Mel and Stanton really helped me to push myself and I did a juice fast for a week - first time ever in my life! Their knowledge is beyond limits and they make you learn some amazing things regarding breathwork  fasting and detoxification  meditation  supplements etc that you can take back home. Everyday is packed with wonderful activities matching your fitness goals. They also have some great local practitioners so bring some extra money for private sessions as you will definitely want 1:1 sessions with some. Oh and did I mention the incredible daily laundry service? Clothes get picked up in the morning and you get them back same evening  nicely pressed and folded. Super clean accommodation with great facilities as well. You also get 3 complementary massages every week for relaxation after a tiring day.I will always remember the workout on the beach  rainy big buddha hike  rainy walk around Naiharn lake  daily ice-baths  super healthy and tasty food  my first ever black rock mountain hike  brutal but amazing deep stretch hot yoga and the list goes on and on. Life is short so do yourself “THE” favor and visit Phuket Cleanse now!!!,5
Lovely place  amazing food  great services and beautiful people.,4
I’ve just had my second visit to Phuket Cleanse. If you’re thinking about booking a health holiday here  just do it. My fellow cleansers included people on their fourth and fifth visits. Why do people keep coming back? - An accepting  warm  environment. The beautiful hosts and team are welcoming and non judgemental. - A diverse  communal group of fellow cleansers. All shapes and sizes. All fitness levels. All inspiring individuals on their own health journeys from around the globe. This isn’t the first pick place for Instagrammer types  although they’d be welcomed too - the vibe is ‘down to earth’ and collective. - The food! Lordy  the food. An abundance of deliciousness full of goodness. - An incredible array of scheduled activities. All inclusive - morning hikes  beach Tai Chi  1on1 Thai boxing  fabulous fitness and swimming classes  meditation  yoga  massages  limitless infra-red sauna/ice bath sessions  and much more. With world class instructors. Or just relax beside the pool with a book. - Activities cater for all goals. I went primarily for nurturing and nutrients  and really enjoyed the wide variety of food with two helpings most lunch and dinners (I also did a juice cleanse for 1.5 days). I exercised like a demon as the activities were all fun. Despite not aiming for weight loss and eating my heart out for most of the week  I lost kilos of fat in 7 days and gained a little muscle. A lovely surprise. My only regret is that I didn’t book for longer. I’ll be back for a third round. Thanks  Mel and Stanton.,5
What a little hidden gem this place is!Wow  where do I begin?What a refreshing and rejuvenating one week I spent here! Like all the stress of the past 2 covid years is gone!They organize everything for you you don’t even have to plan anything  the group fitness classes  the ice baths and sauna  the yoga  meditation  tai chi  the meals  the hikes  the cooking classes  the island visits! What a package! You can even get 1-1 PT lessons (for extra charge) if you wanted to. There’s even therapy  hypnosis  energy healing and other interesting options for 1-1 with amazing therapists (for extra charge otherwise it’s group sessions which are very beneficial). I learned more in one week than I did in my 31 years!I have come out of this one week experience fitter  healthier  more educated about food  fitness and spirituality  rejuvenated  happier  with friends that I will keep for a lifetime!This place is good for you whatever your level of fitness  yoga  nutrition is. They make you feel welcome  they don’t judge you and they take you in like one of their own. There is non of that pretentious new-age “fit” and “yogi” vibe.The energy and vibe of the place is incredible thanks to it being ran by the two incredible founders Mel and Stansted.Every coach whether it’s yoga  HIIT  running  or swimming is some of the most elite in their fields. This place isn’t a joke! But it also accommodates every level.Every day and every class is different.I stayed here end of Feb 2022 and was really worried about covid but they are super careful and accommodating. It’s been a great experience. You don’t even need to leave the retreat unless it’s organized by Phuket Cleanse. They take care of you from A-Z.The warmth and hospitality makes you feel like you’re home from day 1.The quality and hygiene of the place makes you feel like you’re in a 4-5 star resort.The food is an explosion of flavors that makes you think you’re in a Michelin star restaurant. Every meal is better than the one before and is completely different to one another. The creativity of the recipes and ingredients is not only delicious but educational as well.It offers great bang for your buck! I am definitely coming back again this year and recommending this place to all of my friends back home.Thank you Phuket Cleanse  Mel  Stansted  the coaches  the admin staff  the kitchen staff for an incredible life changing experience!,5
Amazing experience! I came here looking for a tribe of likeminded people and in just a few days made friends for life. The food is some of the best I’ve ever had; hikes  workouts and personal training sessions intense and powerful; meditations life changing. Thanks Mel  Tamara  Tor  Jenny and everyone else for making our short stay an unforgettable experience. As almost everyone else we have met  we will be back… soon. 🙏🏻,5
Wow! Life changing experience for me. All in a month. I have chronic pain condition Fybromyalgia and all that comes with that … Years of baffled consultants  medications  reactions to medications. Rock bottom. Mel & her team provided support coaching and a wealth of knowledge simply with ancient plant based diet  various breathwork techniques and valuable emotional detox sessions. I also benefited greatly from ancient vibrational sound therapy using Himalayan Singing Bowls. We are vibration after all! Oh and please give the Ice Bath a chance. Game changer for me and all I witnessed doing it. With this combination I lost 2 dress sizes in my one month stay at Phuket Cleanse. The facilities  the positive vibe  the family feel and the progress you see in yourself and fellow cleansers is phenomenal! Phuket Cleanse has to be on your list of things to experience post pandemic. It’ll reset your mind body and soul. Literally! Make that Phuket Cleanse enquiry…. It’ll change your life. Thanks Mel and all the PC Team for your first class experience. I’ll never ever forget it.,5
It's hard to describe - everything fits!!! The team lives the spirit with every breath and is highly professional. It's like home away from home. Every guest becomes a friend  they look after you  engage with you. But the offering is also unique! The mix of sports  meditation  fun  nutrition makes the place so wonderful. You can easily occupy yourself the whole day - in fact  it's hard to decide with such a huge offering. Hardcore workouts  meditating in silence  all mixed up. It's not possible to put it into words properly. The uncomplicated perfection. I will come back  that's for sure! I have found friends for life there. Many  many heartfelt thanks to all of you for these wonderful three weeks. With love  Andrea,5

Phuket Cleanse has it all! It is beautifully located by Rawai Beach  which is a beautiful beach  just a walk away from Phuket Cleanse. ||||My holiday started with the contact before departure  where I was carefully guided through a myriad of options. Stanton and Melanie  who are the owners and founders of this little paradise  have a unique way of involving and taking care of their guests. The service  friendliness  and hospitality are quite unique! The atmosphere at the place is filled with good energy  balance  and a focus on making your holiday the best possible.

All 3 wishes were fulfilled and more. I was filled with all the good energy at the place  I tried out all kinds of training forms by super competent instructors  and I relaxed in beautiful surroundings. ||||The food is a chapter of its own. An extravagant buffet of all kinds of specialties. What an amazing experience!

Phuket Cleanse is an amazing place for your mind  body  and soul  regardless of what's happening in your life. I would recommend it to anyone. We went as a team incentive because I wanted my employees to learn about alternative ways to approach health beyond the usual. They learned a lot and have gained many tools to use in their daily lives and to share with their own family and friends.Every member of the PC team is friendly and welcoming  and you truly feel like you are part of a big family. I have had some incredible and special moments at Phuket Cleanse and will always return when I feel the need  as it has provided me with a safe haven full of like-minded people.,5
I visited Phuket cleanse back in April 2019 and wanted to take the time to express how incredible this place is. My intention for coming was an emotional detox as well as fitness. I was so happy to finally be doing this and putting myself first for a change  however  was also I little nervous. I was so overwhelmed by the love and care that I was welcomed with from the minute I arrived to even when I was back in Dubai. I have never experienced such a place where I felt there were a genuine connection and lovingness with a group of strangers from the team to the people staying here. It is impossible to mention everyone my name however I do want to mention a few: Jen  Katie  Rita  Chrissie  went over and above of what they had to and it was very touching! They really wanted to help me on my journey and did whatever they could to support. However  the whole team was absolutely amazing! I had such a special time here and left feeling loved and stronger and definitely will be coming back. They have created something truly beautiful and I think everyone should experience PC☺,5
Spent 1 day here  unfortunately  would like more. Truly exclusive place where you feel chosen. Nothing remarkable outside  all the interesting stuff is inside. Incredible meditations  yoga  and impeccable spa complex. Unexpectedly met a world-famous pop star here. A secret and inconspicuous place from the outside  where luxury is in the details and essence in the quality of services and of course in the level of neighbors. If you figure it out and calculate  it's quite justified. Also liked that on the territory (it's huge  if you walk around  although again from the outside it seems like 2 small houses) there are several private zones  furnished like for a magazine cover photoshoot. Nice to sit and meditate. Found it on Google Maps not immediately  but the very pleasant owner Stanton instantly called me and met me  everything is great. Highly recommend. Oh  and it's only a 5-minute drive to Ao Sane Beach (in my opinion  the most romantic on Phuket).,5
The hosts and staff are supper friendly and supportive! The food are just so good and presentable   literally I had to take photo for each dish before eating. I had the greatest pleasure staying in PC and recharging myself! Thanks Jen  Wan  Max  Ben  Paula. Will be back for sure!,5
I have joined Phuket Cleanse third times! Love the whole set up.awesome food  the host and staff  activities and the relaxing ambience!,5
My cousin and I  along with her beautiful lady  were guests at Fokat Cleans for 8 days. One of the best vacations I've ever had in my life. The atmosphere created by the Fokat Cleans trainers was very warm and intimate  yet incredibly relaxing. Important things in my life that were not considered a priority before this serious trip are now easily accessible to me. I didn't drink coffee for 8 days by my own will  did yoga and exercise every day  immediately made very good friends  spent every day on the beach  ate healthy and delicious food every day  learned  and every day we were in the ice bath of Francesco. The hardest part for me was saying goodbye to all these amazing people. But we are planning our next trip to this resort. It's been 6 days since I returned and there is still no news of coffee  and yoga  ice bath  and good memories continue,5

I arrived at Phuket Cleanse thinking if this place would help me start the year on the right foot and renewed. For me  it has been an incredible experience. Now I have +30 new friends from many parts of the world. This is a place to experience  learn  and feel good. I have learned a lot from the nutrition  breathing  meditation  cooking classes. They have many sports classes throughout the day to choose from. I have tried activities that I had not done before (aerial yoga  bikram yoga  SUP  HIIT) and others that I had done before (pilates  stretching  weight training.). I am impressed with the cold water pool  where Francesco has taught us to breathe in such a way that we can spend 30 minutes in water with ice blocks. The coaching sessions have helped me a lot  and I will continue to have sessions with Sam. The Ajna Light meditation with Rita has connected me with my happiness and something has changed within me for the better. The food at this place is very healthy and spectacular - and you always have the ingredients of everything you eat and can ask for the recipes. The people who work there are super friendly and always help you. The body and foot massages  the laundry done punctually every day - are impeccable services already included in the price. Without a doubt  this place has changed my relationship with food  sports  meditation  and personal care. The only thing I didn't like is having to leave! Stanton and Mel are amazing and always there with their humor and knowledge. Thank you. I will definitely come back.,5
The schedule is full of options  and can feel overwhelming sometimes  and if it does  and you’re not sure what to do  why not ask yourself a question that the beautiful soul Sam will teach you in one of her incredible talks about self-love: “what would I do if I loved myself?”. If you get to meet the incredibly handsome Stanton and beautiful Mel – you are in for a treat. These two have created a little piece of cool  a safe space  an energetic representation of their hopes for their guests – transformation. In terms of recommendations I have the following: 1. Do things you would never normally do – there is zero judgement at PC  and 100% support  and in places which make you feel a little weird you learn the most about yourself  and you may just find a new hobby! 2. Take advantage of the breathing and meditation classes – they changed everything and are the bedrock and reason why there is this peaceful and free energy circulating the grounds of PC. Mel and Rita breath into this place all their heart and soul – transcending you to places that enable you to really let go. 3. Suzie reminds you how when you were young  when you would draw  you would unknowingly and with ease simultaneously express who you are and what you feel at the very moment. She gives you techniques like mandala making to bring you back to your inner calm and self. She does it in a framework that is relaxed  loving  open and joyful. Everyone can create. 4. Venus will then elevate you to other realms. Venus moved me  awoke my inner spirit that was so tired from it all  and lit a fire in me that I can continue to replenish. 5. What about movement? Neo’s challenges you positively and in the same breath she will support you. Driving you forward to hold that pose  to stretch outwards more  to lift yourself higher. If you want to take part in one of the calmest  most focused yoga classes  and be mesmerised by someone’s voice  try Stas’s yoga classes. Maria’s deep stretch class will leave you in a harmonious state. Get your form in check with Elle and her Pilates and Booty classes. Pilates is now in my exercise regime. Learn where your pelvis is people. I felt stronger with Elle’s classes. 6. Listen to what Sam has to teach you about self-love  goal-setting and purposeful living – coming from a place where she has taught herself the same techniques  this is real experience  and real and potent advice  from a lovely  beautiful woman. You leave empowered and more kind to yourself. Complement with energetic and well-thought out talks from Chris – you will show you how you CANtra. Hear what Sophie has to say about mind body connection – this shamanic power shares truths that needs to be appreciated. Be educated by Craig  when you leave  able to understand the links clearly as he explains everything so concisely. Craig can analyse your bloods like a detective. The FOOD! The food is delicious. Eat it up people  go to a cooking class that excites you  or a raw chocolate class from the delectable Little Miss Raw! It changes every day  the culinary staff put on a show – they are geniuses. The massage therapists! Oh my word! Four massages a week included  and endless foot massages whilst listening to a meditation. The team have hands that undo all the hard work you have done  and all the stress you’ve felt. The foot massage put us to sleep EVERY TIME. How do they do that? The other guests! We met incredible people whilst at PC and made some very important friendships. Something I didn’t think about before going. In short: PC can reform/ unlearn the old to learn the new/ upgrade/change/cleanse you in a multitude of ways: mind  emotions  heart  body  spirt . if you’re open to it. We have been able to keep many of the learnings with us  as the team also teach you how to carry on without them  taking their techniques back to your world like PC ninjas  able to manage yourself with care  manage situations with calm and to do the things that make you feel joy in your body. Peace and love  Moushira and Mobs,5
We came to Phuket Cleanse from La Paz  Bolivia and it was a UNIQUE experience. We did a variety of activities and the most beautiful thing was that we could do it all together! We had a routine that filled us with energy along with healthy and nutritious food. We can only thank the whole team and the people who made us feel at home. For welcoming us with so much love  affection  and positive energy every day. We left very happy  with a full heart  a few pounds less  and the desire to return soon.Thank you Phuket Cleanse for the kindness  love  and positive energy. We left with a full heart  a few pounds less  and we can’t wait to be back.,5

For welcoming us with so much love  affection  and positive energy every day. We left very happy  with a full heart  a few pounds less  and the desire to return soon. ||||Thank you Phuket Cleanse for the kindness  love  and positive energy. We left with a full heart  a few pounds less  and we can’t wait to be back!,5
Nothing is appetizing to me anymore after enjoying phenomenal healthy meals throughout my stay. I would go back just for the food alone. Phuket Cleanse knows service. All-inclusive means all-inclusive and includes airports transfers  meals  daily laundry  daily foot massages  almost daily body massages  and numerous activities and talks. I enjoyed and took advantage of many active and self-help sessions and leave with the enthusiasm to live a healthier life. The staff is high-spirited  friendly  and motivating. I only wish I stayed longer and knew about this place years ago. Thanks Stanton and everyone at PC.,5
A friend went to Phuket Cleanse  he said it’ll be quite a NEW experience. So me and wife made our 8 days visit in August. Stanton is so humorous and the team is very nice  you can feel how everyone is eager to help you make the most out of this program. There is a wide variety of activities to choose from  we had a lot of “first time” here. And I have to say you’ll have the best massage in Phuket (this is my fifth visit to Phuket)  we signed up for foot massage everyday. The food is quite special and super healthy  dining table is nicely dressed with different theme every meal  romantic~ Its about 30 guests on site  getting to know people from all over the world and sharing ideas on fitness is enjoyable. Don’t hesitate  sign up the program right away  its definitely worthwhile. Can’t wait to go back for another round of detox. A good friend has been there and said it would be a brand new experience. My wife and I arranged an eight-day trip in August. The boss Stanton is very humorous  the whole team is very friendly  actively helping each person design daily schedules to ensure more gains. There are many different types of activities to choose from  and forty percent of the content is a first-time experience for us. I have to say  the massages here are the best I've experienced in Phuket (this is my fifth visit to Phuket). The food is very special and super healthy  with the dining table carefully arranged for each meal  quite romantic. There are about 30 guests from all over the world  and it's wonderful to interact and exchange ideas on life and health. Don't hesitate anymore  let's go~ We will go back again.,5
My first experience at a health and wellness retreat. I stayed there in their Pyramid Villa which had a private pool. My stay with them was for 2 weeks  Prior to visiting I wasn't in the best of shape health-wise  but Stanton and his great team of individuals  programs daily for many activities to kick your butt into improving your mind  body and soul. not to mention their nutritionist Majella  who was fantastic in preparing amazing vegan meals for breakfast  lunch and Dinner. I was lucky enough to participate in a juice detox for 4 days of this time  which at the end of it was an amazing gift to my body  to say the least. My time there consisted of activities like cycling around Rawai each day  swimming  hot Bikram yoga  strength class  HiiT  stand up paddle boarding at the local beach  meditation  cooking classes  ice-bath (Thanks Stanton)  and hot steam room and not to mention mindfulness talks from people in the know. very Inspiring and would recommend this retreat to anyone  any age  walks of life. It was such a blessing to have met the amazing people that I did. Had an amazing time and if you go  your body will thank you. Sometimes you gotta revitalize your soul. SO grateful for this experience! Stanton is pretty handsome ,5
Phuket Cleanse gave me new energy when I was exhausted. When I first made a reservation  I was debating whether to stay for a week or two  but as soon as I arrived at Phuket Cleanse  I could easily decide to stay for two weeks. I was impressed by everything at Phuket Cleanse - from Vikram yoga to Muay Thai  a variety of exercises  delicious food to the point of forgetting it's vegan  workshops for healing  and healthy cooking classes. The friendly and genuinely caring staff  guests from various countries who sweated together during workouts and enjoyed meals happily  seem to be the special charm of Phuket Cleanse. That's why many guests seem to be coming back to Phuket Cleanse. Looking forward to the next visit  Thank you so much  Phuket Cleanse & Stanton!!!,
I went there and I really enjoyed it everyone is so friendly  and you learn a lot about health and fitness when you go there,5
alot gained from a relatively short stay. great staff and a fantastic offering. ill be back.,5
It has been such an amazing time off to myself. Can't believe a place can have such a positive effect on a person in such a short time. A healing place with beautiful souls and amazing team. Will be back again very soon. Thank you PC,5
I recently visited Phuket Cleanse with my partner for the second time. This is why: Community: One of the most attractive features of PC is the community vibe. From my experience  you get a feel for the PC culture as soon as you arrive. Both the PC team and guests are extremely friendly  supportive and accepting  regardless of your background or appearance. PC look after you: One of the challenging things to do whilst travelling is searching and organising things to do. PC looked after everything including the airport shuttle to and from the site  the activities  the amazing food and even the daily laundry. I felt valued. Fitness: PC has an extensive fitness offering for people of all shapes  sizes and fitness levels. The daily schedule included Muay Thai  HIIT  Beach HIIT  Yoga (many varieties)  mobility  Big Buddha hike and many more. Relaxation: Daily massages  meditation (many varieties)  Yin yoga  meditation  breathing meditation. I felt I was able to escape my stress load at home and reset properly. Self-development: PC puts on regular talks with competent presenters on topics covering diet  nutrition  wellness  stress management and lifestyle to name a few. I always take home a lot of valuable information from various speakers. PC is one of my favourite getaway destinations and worth every cent.,5
J'y suis passée car je souhaitais avoir des infos sur ce qu'ils proposent et laissé mes coordonnées et personne ne m'a rappelée. Je trouve que pour un établissement qui propose un programme de detox sans nettoyage du côlon n'est pas complet et insuffisant.,2
Ich kann nur sagen dieser Ort ist einzigartig! Absolut alles ist mit unglaublicher Hingabe und Perfektion gestaltet  das Essen ist organisch und vegan es wird auf höchste Gesundheit geachtet? So wird sogar der Lachs eingeflogen aus Neuseeland  die Aktivitäten sind unbegrenzt  das Bikram Yoga ist nirgendwo so gut und ich vermisse noch jeden Tag das Essen. ICE Bath und Sauna nach dem Sport unbegrenzte Möglichkeit an Sport Aktivitäten und die besten Yoga Lehrer  Coaches. wenn man diesen Ort verlässt fühlt man sich wie neu geboren. Danke phuket Cleanse !!!,
It was a surreal experience  in every sense of the word! I came here with very specific goals in mind  mostly to up my fitness game and get out of my training slump  but my stay became so much more! I was like a child in a (~healthy) candy store  grabbing as much opportunity as I can get to better myself in all aspects-body  mind and soul. It's the complete package! The social dimension in the retreat just makes it even better - it's like you're part of the tribe the moment you step in. It's one of the best and meaningful experiences I've ever had and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to make positive changes in their lives!,5
I was there for 9 days in August and could have stayed another month. The vegan raw food was excellent  the sport choices were many and diverse. ( Paddle board  Muay Thai Boxing  Insanity workshop  Crossfit  Free diving techniques  Aqua fit  Hot Yoga  Birkam  hiking  biking  aerial yoga  etc. The nourishing of the soul came in many forms  Meditation  Mayan Cacao ceremonies  Rebirthing  Historical emotional pain recovery  seriously. you come out of there recharged and ready to tackle anything again :) I highly recommend.,5
Sleep well and peacefully.,5
Phuket Cleanse delivered from the moment I got out of the taxi. The staff are welcoming and friendly  the service professional and consistent. I loved the meals and juices and never went hungry. There is such a variety of dishes on the menu and I was left in awe of what the chef and kitchen staff managed to produce at every meal. All diary  sugar and gluten free. You are able to effortlessly follow a vegan  raw or carb free diet as they cater for all. The weight I lost after a week was just the cherry on top. Every day starts with a hike and it is a fantastic way to see parts of the island while burning some calories. I also did hot yoga  aerial yoga  Mauy Thai  SUP boarding  cycling and aqua classes. The recovery programme is superb - ice bath  infra red sauna  steam room and even a Thai massage in your room before bed. That would have all been enough to get a 5 star rating from me  but they go even further in their holistic approach to your well-being by providing various meditations  interesting educational talks and cooking classes. The weekends wind down slightly with boat trips to the islands and shopping at the night market. Communal meals times keep it social and I made friends from all over the world. I look forward to meeting up with some of them in the future because Phuket Cleanse is definitely a repeat experience. I highly recommend this trip to everyone  you will not be disappointed - the hardest part is trying to fit everything in! Thank you Stanton and your wonderful team at Phuket Cleanse. Until next time.,5
Phuket Cleanse offers beautiful accommodation  sensational food  all within a healthy lifestyle program with sauna  steam room and a ice bath. There is a full day of activities everyday . All this sends you home rejuvenated  feeling great and ready to take on the world. The hosts and staff welcome you as family. This was our first time and will differently be going back  there were several other guests who had stayed there four or five times. Why go anywhere else?,5
I was feeling a little lost in my own world of being a mother  a wife  a friend  a sister  a worker and many other roles that I finally decided to find myself as my own person. My daughter decided to book this vacation for the 2 of us to spend some time together and to do the things that we both love doing. (I am blessed to have a wonderful daughter.) It was a heavenly choice. When we reached Phuket Cleanse  the staff gave us a warm welcome and Stanton lit the whole place with his warmth  care and love wherever he went. It was such a joy to see him and I always look forward to his presence. He made me feel so happy. I could never be without a smile  a chuckle or a bust of laughter whenever he was around. Its a blessing to have met him. The food and juices were excellent. beyond words and everyday we looked forward to a new theme to the meal. I was never without a bottle of cool refrigerated water to keep me hydrated. The day's schedule was packed with exciting and adventurous activity. The yoga sessions  the hikes  the meditation  the beaches. etc.etc. My usual day in life is routine and here I am trying out all that I possibly thought I could accomplish and if I did not feel so  the trainers would push me with gentle encouragement and spunky motivation. On top of it all  to ease the day with a relaxed hour or so  finding myself through the Anja Light. An experience that will stay with me forever. The Ice Bath was a mad experience for me but I was so excited to have made it in for a couple of seconds. hahaha. cool!!.I made a lot of friends there and even if it was for a short time  the memories will forever stay with me in my heart. I am now back home  rejuvenated and busting with energy and motivation to move forward. Whatever your reasons. a vacation  a time-out  an adventure  etc  I truly and sincerely recommend a stay at Phuket Cleanse. Thank you EVERYONE at Phuket Cleanse for giving me an experience that will always  always be a part of me. I will be back!!,5
Home away from home. This is for me Cleanse Phuket. Viaggio soggiorno accoglienza eccezionale.si respira l'aria hippie di una grande famiglia.inoltre  ci sono trainer e terapisti preparati per ogni esigenza. Il cibo é buonissimo  genuino e cucinato con amore. É un incontro di culture e di energie che vibrano e riempiono le giornate di benessere e sorrisi. Da tornare almeno 1 volta all'anno. Il rientro in citta' non era mai stato cosi' difficile. Hippie happy vegan family miss you!,5
After neglecting my accumulating workload  overtime  and excessive eating and drinking at company dinners  my mental state was deteriorating. However  after setting my New Year's resolution for 2017 as 'getting healthier' and following a friend's recommendation  my visit to Phuket Cleanse exceeded my expectations. ||||During my 5-day stay in Phuket with the main purpose of improving my physical fitness and relaxation  the Phuket Cleanse program offered a variety of activities from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily  including hiking  cycling  crossfit  Muay Thai boxing  stand-up paddling  swimming  and various yoga classes  providing an extraordinary experience of rapid and significant physical improvement. Additionally  I was able to enjoy relaxation activities such as daily meditation sessions  free time at the beach  visiting the night market in Phuket  Thai cooking classes  and receiving massages four times a week provided by Phuket Cleanse. ||||However  one slightly challenging aspect for me personally was that all the food provided by Phuket Cleanse is vegan  and coffee is not served during breakfast. For someone like me who enjoys coffee and meat  it may require a bit of an adjustment period. Nevertheless  the delicious food made me forget about being a non-vegan for a while  and I could return home as a vegan with a smile. ||||I highly recommend Phuket Cleanse to working professionals who want to achieve both health and relaxation in a short period of time!,5
This is a magical place! Just a few days are enough to change my life! Stanton and his team are so warm and welcoming  it feels like family. Here you can find the best coaches in the world  who help you tailor a personalized fitness plan and provide delicious food! Although I only stayed for a few days  I feel my body becoming lighter. More importantly  this place has filled me with passion for life  hoping to become a better version of myself. This is one of the most precious experiences in my life. Missing all the friends who purified themselves in Phuket  I can't wait for the next journey!,5
An extraordinary concept that raises awareness that well-being and health are a global concept combining Nutrition  Exercise  and also Meditation. The stay is not cheap but the price is clearly justified given the hundreds of high-quality services included on-site. The concept is perfect for singles or people traveling alone on vacation because many people are there alone and you meet extraordinary people! In 10 days  I lost 5 Kilos  of which 3kg were just fat. I learned to cook super healthy and rebalance my diet. I came back relaxed and in great shape. TOP NOTCH:)))) I recommend,5
A huge thank you to the organizers of this unforgettable vacation  which combines both relaxation and health improvement! ||Melanie and Stanton were able to bring to life in this paradise completely uncharacteristic things for this region. This includes extreme entertainment with a sauna and ice-holes  which are only present in Russia and Northern Europe  and that's not all! For your body  muscles  and ligaments  experienced instructors have prepared a valuable complex of health exercises that can be listed from A to Z  including the simplest exercises and exercises worthy of a master. All of this together creates an unforgettable impression! Also included is a special Thai massage every other day.||The food at the hotel is so fresh and good that everyone will find something to their taste  but there is no meat  which is part of the hotel's overall concept aimed at body wellness.||The staff is excellent  with Russian trainers and assistants available.,5
Stay to lose weight and get back into sports with a good diet. We stayed for 2 weeks with intensive sports  appropriate nutrition  massages at the end of the day in our room. The staff takes great care of its clients  full of little attentions. In the end  -10kg lost and nothing regained to this day..,5
Nice place. nice food. Friendly.. We are waiting for you.,5
I have just spent 2 weeks aiming to lose weight  doing a lot of sports  and meditating. Everything was perfect: the very professional organization  the variety of sports including Thai boxing  yoga in a sauna. I was able to enjoy the remarkable vegetarian cuisine and even stopped drinking coffee  which I didn't think was possible. Everyone is very caring with great kindness. The evening massage in the room is a bonus that helps relieve muscles tired from a long day. It is preferable to speak English to understand the advice well and to talk with the many visitors from Europe  North America  and South America. In summary  a very beautiful and sporty stay.,5
I'm only halfway through the 12 days I committed to this incredible Thai retreat for self rejuvenation. Sans caffeine  sugar and cared for by the worlds most amazing desk staff among many others  I feel whole physically for the first time in six or seven years. There are truly not enough stars for Phuket Cleanse. I have been to several other health retreats. The food is amazing  healthy  the juices phenomenal. 'Kitchen staff' is just not what I would call the chefs  fruit and veggie magicians extraordinaire. I had an offer of a head and neck massage from 'O'at the desk to alleviate a headache. O- thank you! You're incredible. My massage therapist  Kaew  is so small  yet so very strong and gifted. Both Thai and traditional massages have been as good as my best at home (sorry Mike!) Additional massages to the four included each week of a stay are 600 bhat  less than $20 for 90 minutes. Simon has made Hot yoga doable. I have less balance than the US media. Eli is a superb trainer. Each private session has been between 2000 and 2500 bhat  $56.00 at today's exchange rate. I have a physiotherapy team to help get rid of the painful tight upper back I've had for years  and I'm consciously aware of posture and core. My daughters will be in shock that I start the day with seaweed instead of a Coke or MountainDew. Anyway I look at it  I can't imagine going anywhere else. The symphony of services and caregivers at Phuket Cleanse more than makes up for any inconveniences of travel across the country and across the Pacific. The value here is beyond words  and the beach is ten minutes away. Thank you Phuket Cleanse for your commitment and care. This may be the best health care delivery system I've ever experienced.,5
I decided to go to Phuket Cleanse to kick off a sabbatical period and a major transition in my profession with a lot of energy. Being a vegetarian person  with a focus on healthy food  who enjoys exercise and has a passion for spirituality and energies  I found in Phuket Cleanse the perfect combination that fits for a period of tranquility and self-discovery:- Taste  variety  and pleasure in food are not sacrificed for the healthy or vegetarian theme!!! The variety of recipes  ideas  exotic flavors  and fine textures make each meal a moment to enjoy!!! The Owners and Chefs have extensive knowledge about nutritional levels and composition of each food and with the flexibility to adjust the dishes to the guests' needs/desires!- Intense and well-planned exercise routines: They have trainers and exercise plans that are very well-focused! There are so many classes that it's not possible to attend all of them  and by the end of the day  your body can't take it anymore! However  you always decide what to do and what not to do. but in each class  the work is intense but well-planned throughout the day  obviously you have time to rest and recover  but energy is what you need.- Good energy with yoga  meditation: If intensive exercise is not your thing  yoga classes for all levels will complement your routine! From sunrise yoga to start with the sun's rays  or meditation in the evenings to end your routines and even sessions that fill your body and soul with energy! Melanie  the owner  has managed to include her energetic discourse in the culture and structure of Phuket Cleanse!And with all of the above. the SERVICE!!! The quality of service was impeccable with a smile all the time!!! Definitely when it's ALL INCLUSIVE  I didn't imagine they would exceed the limits of my imagination!I could write more and more. but if you want to know  please contact me and I could provide more testimony of my experience!!,5
Beautiful place  beautiful people :) A Fun way to get Healthy and Learn about Health ~,5
Fairly unfamiliar with this type of culinary and physical experience in France  we decided to embark on the Detox adventure in Phuket during our stay  and what an experience !!! The welcome was fantastic  the setting is superb  the meals are delicious  the programs are very well balanced  and the atmosphere is great. Highly recommended and it's good for your health :),5
I really loved the place  soundhealing sessions  yoga. The staff is attentive and nice. If I come back to Phuket   will visit you again  guys!,5

Hello everyone! I rarely leave reviews  but it seems that I have found the most cozy and cool place for workouts  restored the balance of my soul and body by attending morning yoga classes. Recently  I found out that you can take classes for personal training. Thanks to this place  I continue to delight the ladies with my body and endurance. Thank you  I will be coming back here again.,5
Did yoga  pulse (circuit training) and sound bath sessions. All were great  Jerome gave solid pointers for the strength training exercises and I worked up a decent sweat. The sound bath is out of this world  such a peaceful/spiritual experience. The studio is beautiful and you can grab a delicious bite at the adjacent woo cafe.,5
What a great place. Professional and friendly stuff  and most importantly very challenging yoga classes. Look no further  this stadia has everything you need.,5
Very nice and cozy place!!! We visited a yoga class and sound bath. Amazing feeling  new experiences good vibe tasty food  gorgeous lake view! We will come back not one more time necessary!!!,5
Best ice bath in Phuket very clean and all staff very professional. Love it,5
MAGICAL PLACE  highly recommend it. I tried 4 different services at Life Balance. 1) Aroma Therapy massage  the best massage I ever received. Perfect mix between soft and hard  so relaxing! 2) Gym: The gym with the most beautiful view ever! I got a very intense and fun personal training that left me feeling super strong. 3) Sound bath: This was such a magical experience  I felt like pure bliss afterwards and I would say this was my favourite part of all the things I tried. 4) Ice Bath! I did the ice bath after my 2 days of intense workouts and it cured my soar muscles. Such a (literally) cool experience. Overall incredibly happy with all the services I booked. I highly recommend this place ♥️♥️♥️,5
Wonderful place can so hight recommend! Yoga classes with Jimmy are excellent  as well as sounbath and other classes. The place a brand new and super clean with a wonderful view on lagune right from the classroom. As a bonus delicious restaurant and ice bath. Cannot recommend more!,5
I've had a workshop here as a yoga teacher in February 2023. This place has the best yoga shala with a warm and surrounding energy inside and the inspiring view outside,5
A very nice place with great atmosphere and beautiful view. Very clean place with a lot of light. I loved sound bath and massage. Thank you!,5
A very warm and cozy place. About such establishments  you want to say: the owner of the house. I especially want to mention the blue-bearded yoga teacher. I have been going to Lifebalance since it opened. Everything is clean. This is important to me. And everyone I recommended this place to is also delighted with the classes  the view  and the place itself. I like the place so much that my husband and I even celebrated our wedding anniversary there  and the yoga teacher conducted a ceremony for us.,5
Friendly environment excellent and caring yoga instructor. Grateful to find this place   Thanks to Jimmy’s yoga lesson to make me feel happy and relaxing .,5
When I come to the studio  I get aesthetic pleasure  an incredible boost of energy after a yoga class with any teacher I go to.Thank you life balance,5
My favorite place to workout in Phuket! High quality workouts and Yoga Highly recommended!,5
Had a wonderful experience with the sound bathing and Jerome. The environment is beautiful. I came out of the session feeling very relaxed and centred. I will be back.,5
Tried emotional meditation class for the first time during my holiday in Phuket. It’s an amazing experience with Jimmy. The class is comprised of a few sessions: yoga  breathing exercise  guided meditation and finally the sound bath. I released a lot of stress and gained emotional stability through the class. The lake view is stunning and a perfect one for the class. Highly recommended!,5
Such a beautiful  clean  scenic spot to train. Great equipment and facilities Shout out to Phil who gave me the best workout  totally different to what I’m used to. He’s super informed and gives a killer session!!! Couldn’t recommend Life Balance more - can’t wait to come back.,5
Absolutely love this place!! Great PT session with Phil followed by a sound bath session with Jerome. Definitely feeling a lot less stressed,5
Everything is great! Location  coaches  atmosphere,5
Very nice place where mindfulness meets aesthetics . I have visited this place several times for sound bath. It was amazingly deep and powerful. And after you can grab organic meal in a very cozy place!,5
Nice place and great location,5
What a location!!! A great place to escape from the noise of life. I've tried both the chakra meditation and sound bath and both are unbelievably relaxing. Highly recommend!! Thank you!!,5
Jerome is a top coach and traîner   incredible spot facing the lake   this man helping me for recover after big spine operation   1 year later I’m completely recover and able to train safely every day with his program . I highly recommend this man . All is about intentions as he loves to say .,5
This is a new place near Boat Avenue / Laguna  with yoga  gym and massage. It's a beautiful and peaceful place by a lake. I did the massage and Kiki is the best masseuse I've encountered in a while. She can literally read your body and gave me a firm yet very relaxing massage. I also do personal training three times a week and I am very happy with the facilities and the very friendly personal and / or group sessions. Highly recommended,5
